Director Robert Zemeckis many years later after discovering the story in a children's novel would create a 3D film based on this event. But most importantly in 2018, J.D.

Also discussed is Crispin Glover's performance as Grendel, Angelina Jolie's hatred for this film, the background behind the Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary screenplay, and the PG-13 rating despite all the violence and horniness.</div><div>

There's really no movie quite like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. How long did "bumping the lamp" take? What's a contemporary take on Jessica and Roger Rabbit's relationship dynamics? How does the film's story mirror Hollywood? We invited the Doughboys themselves, Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger to help us find out!<br><br>

Though it wasn’t her directorial debut, you just don’t do Nora Ephron without covering When Harry Met Sally. We invited Slate critic and podcast host Dana Stevens (Culture Gabfest, Flashback) to discuss the 1989 classic and ask the big questions. How is Billy Crystal so damn charming? Which Meg Ryan hairstyle is best? And most importantly...can men and women be friends???<br><br>This episode is sponsored by:<br><a href="https://www.noom.com/">NOOM</a> (CODE: Check)</div>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Guest <a href="https://www.themcelroy.family/">Justin McElroy</a> is gonna be mad he volunteered to do any film when Griff and David talk about Demme's first two tries at "real" movies after his Roger Korman saga. The trio talk about CB, or "Citizen's Band," and Last Embrace, a surprisingly Judaic Thriller. The films contain oddly touching birthday party scenes, IMDB spoilers,  children named Blood, and the introduction of heavy concepts that are never dealt with. Did Ben Kingsley win an Oscar?  What's Justin's 30-second Tim Robbins story? Also what is Mandy Patinkin, the Patinkiest, doing in this movie? <br><br>This episode is sponsored by:<br><a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/check">Honey</a><br><a href="https://bombas.com/pages/check">Bombas</a><br><a href="https://www.parcast.com/villains">Villains</a> from Parcast</div>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It’s the first episode of a new mini-series. You voted for him, you’ve only yourself to blame for JONATHAN DEMME. Probably one of the directors with the most range of films - from rom coms to serious dramas - Griffin and David start with the first three of his films, each a strange genre movie: Caged Heat about a prison break; Crazy Mama about women doing crimes; and Fighting Mad which pits farmers vs coal companies. What is the appeal of women’s prison movies? Literally what is Michael Richards doing all day? Can art be non-political nowadays? And what exactly makes Demme SO iconic that he’s such an influencer? <br><br>This episode is sponsored by:<br><a href="https://www.brooklinen.com/">Brooklinen</a> CODE: CHECK<br><a href="https://www.kiwico.com/blank">KiwiCo</a><br><a href="https://publicrec.com/check">Public Rec</a>

  <description>Richard Lawson returns to discuss the late-Burton effort: 2014's Big Eyes. But why are the eyes so big? Should Christoph Waltz be the star of his own network TV sitcom? How did Burton pull off making the focus of this movie about the main character's abuser? Together they examine the eyes (which are big), Margaret Keane's history and Alita: Battle Angel (which is also known as Big Eyes 2.)

  <description>Blank Check continues its mini-series covering the films of director Tim Burton with the alien invasion comedy, Mars Attacks! But what are the origins of development for this 1960's trading card IP? How does this movie compare to Independence Day 20 years later? Does David have a half-sister, and if so, why has she never been mentioned before? Joined by comedian, Paul F. Tompkins (BoJack Horsman), they discuss the various performances of this stacked ensemble cast, the unusual billing, face goop, Entourage the movie and extreme Burton stereotypes such as happy suburban people and haunted ghost children. This episode is sponsored by [Robinhood](http://check.robinhood.com) and [eero](https://eero.com/check) CODE: CHECK.

And be sure to check out Paul at [Vancouver's Just for Laughs Festival Sunday, February 17th with 'Mr. Jackson &amp; Mr. Tompkins: A Two-Gentleman Improv Show'!](http://www.jflnorthwest.com/show/jackson-tompkins-vogue-theatre/)</description>

Together, they examine the careers of Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and Jude “Daddy” Law; Christmas in England; loving movie scores enough to make gibberish sounds in public places and Venom being SO rude.

Amato (The President Show) returns, in the last episode of our mini series devoted to the filmography of director Ang Lee, to discuss 2016’s high frame rate Iraq War drama, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. But what makes this movie so revolutionary?

  <description>This week Blank Check begins a new mini series reviewing the filmography of director Brad Bird with a discussion of 1999’s critically acclaimed animated feature, The Iron Giant. But does the Iron Giant wear a shirt? Did the studio request this movie be set in present day and have a hip hop soundtrack? Should Griffin and David fight more? Together, in their worst episode ever, they examine Brad Bird’s origin story, the hotness of Harry Connick Jr. as beatnik industrial artist Dean McCoppin, the upcoming Blank Check Pictures slate and booger stores.</description>

But why would Brooks at this moment in history sympathize with the business executives being held accountable for their corporate malfeasance? What does it mean when referring to a scene as a steam room? And also how do you know? Together they examine the careers of Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson, the Australian word for ‘grogan,’ and the 120 million dollar budget.

  <description>Richard Lawson (author of All We Can Do Is Wait) returns to discuss 2004’s Spanglish. But is this movie really about James L. Brooks attempting to justify why he wants to sleep with his maid? Is it believable a character has never seen a man cry? Is this film available on blu-ray and will it’s value increase over time like bitcoins? Together they examine Adam Sandler’s career, Téa Leoni’s VERY big performance, using monologues from Spanglish for auditioning and birthdays at a themed restaurant called Mars 2112\. This episode is sponsored by Brooklinen (PROMO: CHECK) and WeTransfer.

  <description>James L. Brooks had originally shot I’ll Do Anything as a musical. But in the test screening it was so disastrous the studio insisted he cut all the musical sequences out and reshoot new scenes to fill it in. Having reviewed that theatrical cut, Griffin and David revisit this film with returning guest Esther Zuckerman and discuss the lost, coveted musical cut of I’ll Do Anything in a special bonus episode. But what would the child of Albert Brooks and Julie Kavner sound like? Why does Griffin insist on singing the horrid song “You Are The Best?” Is this episode haunted? Together they go through all the musical numbers and try to decide if this version of the movie makes it any less worse.</description>

  <description>Writer and friend of the show Esther Zuckerman joins Griffin and David to discuss 1994’s I'll Do Anything. But was this film originally developed and shot as a musical only to be reedited into a mostly non-musical? Were prolific musicians Prince, Sinéad O'Connor and Carole King brought on to write the songs for this movie? Did Nick Nolte really win People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive in 1992? Together they examine the inside baseball dealings of Hollywood, the bad 90’s fashion, honest curses and comedic frontal nudity.

But was this film originally developed and shot as a musical only to be reedited into a mostly non-musical? Were prolific musicians Prince, Sinéad O&#39;Connor and Carole King brought on to write the songs for this movie? Did Nick Nolte really win People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive in 1992? Together they examine the inside baseball dealings of Hollywood, the bad 90’s fashion, honest curses and comedic frontal nudity.

But why is this not your grandfather’s invisible man movie? What was the running Joey Slotnick bit on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn? Does this film lack the satire and point of view of Verhoven’s past movies? Together they discuss the career trajectory of Kevin Bacon, poorly executed Tarantino-esque schoolyard jokes, the original Dark Universe of the 1990s and why this film’s poor reception caused Verhoeven to retreat back to the Netherlands.

Does this film lack the satire and point of view of Verhoven’s past movies?

Together they discuss 1990’s _twisted_ sci-fi thriller, Total Recall. But how much creative control did Arnold have over this film? What is Michael Ironside actual first name? Are all the Johnny cabs designed so that if a passenger skips on the fare the robot driver’s head explodes? Their conversation includes peak practical effects, Robert Costanzo playing himself in the film and if the story that unfolds is in fact all just a dream.

Is it true that Verhoeven initially read half a page of the script and threw in the trash only to have his wife retrieve it and encourage him to give it a second chance? Together they examine the construction and evolution of the RoboCop costume, breaking squib records, 1987’s Academy award winners and many other tangents.

Already an accomplished filmmaker in the Netherlands, 1985 marked his American debut with the unpleasantly realistic period piece, Flesh+Blood. But how gross was the medieval times? What was the influence of growing up under Nazi occupation on Verhoeven’s worldview? Is it intended for the viewer to root for the plague? Together, Griffin and David discuss his original Dutch movies, Bosch paintings, and how Flesh+Blood’s failure at the box office would inform his study of American culture and his future films.</description>

  <description>Joe Garden (The Onion) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss the mo-cap animated action/mystery, The Adventures of Tintin. But what was Peter Jackson’s involvement in the project? How is the character Tintin like a fine sparkling wine? Is Will &amp; Grace really coming back? Together, they compare the film to the original children book series by Hergé, examine the lessons children were taught in the 1930’s, again revisit Mystery Men and also suggest what actor would make a good Professor Calculus for any future sequels.</description>

Could a more suited director and screen writer have been brought onto the production? How long has Sir Anthony Hopkins been phoning it in exactly? Together they examine the career trajectory of Matthew McConaughey, Peter Firth receives comedy points and assess the cast in a performance review.</description>

  <description>The debut of our new mini series on the filmography of Steven Spielberg begins with 1997’s Lost World: Jurassic Park. Post-Oscar wins for Best Director and Best Picture, Steven took four years off before directing this sequel. In that time he founded his own studio DreamWorks. Griffin and David would argue this level of creative control is the biggest blank check that any filmmaker has ever had. Presenting Pod Me If You Cast.&#13;
&#13;
But seriously what IS chaos math? Why does this film unfold similarly to a video game? What does Isla Nublar roughly translate to?&#13;
&#13;
Together #thetwofriends discuss the careers of Laura Dern, Vince Vaughn, Jeff Goldblum, convenient islands, life finding a way and a epic Pete Postlethwaite monologue.</description>

  <description>Griffin, David and guest host Producer Ben present a special episode this week: a discussion of 1995’s action thriller Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.&#13;
&#13;
But is it true the co-founder of CAA and former Disney president, Michael Ovitz, bet he could make even a stocky Aikido teacher with zero acting experience a star? Does Hollywood make these b-list midsize action movies anymore? Is Steven Seagal our quietest action hero?&#13;
&#13;
Together the trio examines New Zealand director and journeyman Geoff Murphy’s career, Eric Bogosian’s performance as the scientist gone bad, earthquake inducing satellites sponsored by the U.S. government and the original song written AND performed by Steven Seagal “After the Train Has Gone.” Plus, share a Hamilton themed Burger Report, review Star Trek Beyond and what occupations Nic Cage said he would like to portray.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, remember dear listener that after this week’s palette cleanser Blank Check will return with our new mini series covering the films of James Cameron!</description>

  <description>In the final episode of the Podchowski Casters mini series, Griffin and David discuss 2003’s collection of animated short films detailing the Matrix expanded universe, The Animatrix. Are Part I and Part II of Second Renaissance a successful prequel to the first Matrix? Does the short “World Record” set it’s own record for the most on-screen knee sweat? What are #thetwofriends final thoughts on the Wachowskis? Together they examine the nine short films featuring several collaborators writers and directors including Peter Chung (Aeon Flux), reasons why Keanu Reeves might not sound like himself, the pointlessness of Alice Through the Looking Glass and why “Kid’s Story” never pays off as intended. Also, a merch spotlight, a Burger Report and why you should check out the original Animatrix website: http://www.intothematrix.com/</description>

  <description>March of 2016, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was released. All two hours and thirty-three minutes of it. The critics and fans agreed, Zach Snyder’s mess of a movie about Batman and Superman fighting was not well liked and made Ben sad. Also around this time, Griffin and David recorded a one-off episode about the film. Due to technical issues, the lost episode was scrapped—until now.</description>

Can the great Kathryn Hahn do no wrong? Does this mean M. Night’s very bad movie streak has finally run out? Together they examine the Blumhouse model, the gross factor versus the gore factor, a dirty diaper in the face and how Shyamalan paying out of pocket for this production might just correlate with it being actually palatable. Also, the original Slenderman, lil Roman Polanski rapping, and a Burger Report with LeBron James.</description>

Beyond starring along side his son Jaden and being credited as a producer and original story writer, how else did Will Smith play a role in the making of this film? Does the timing of After Earth’s release have anything to do with Jaden’s emancipation from his parents? Is it possible for M. Night to ever work again after 5 sequential critical and commercial failures? Together they examine Will’s illustrious career up to After Earth, the development of Jaden’s stardom, having emotion, giving your monsters the ability to see and the duality of what is happening in this movie is happening in real life.</description>

When adapting the the original animated series, why did M. Night try to incorporate ALL 20 episodes of the first season into one movie? How do the casting choices reflect negatively on the film? Was Last Airbender so terrible that the BC crew in this episode talks about basically anything else? Yes, yes it is.

Was this the the twist that finally did Shyamalan in or was his reputation already tarnished? Together, the gang examines the color that will remained unnamed, going “simple jack”, a popular website in the early oughts called The Smoking Gun and why for the love of all that is holy does Night keep casting himself?!</description>

  <description>Matt Patches (Thrillist, Grantland) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss Shyamalan’s fourth feature, Unbreakable. This sad and muted superhero film where mostly nothing happens was seen by many critics and fans as a “sophomore slump” when released in 2000. But what are some of it’s redeeming qualities? How does it stand out among the Marvel superhero movie craze in the years that followed?&#13;
&#13;
Oh and is there a twist you ask? Well listen along as the gang unpacks the making and reception of Unbreakable, together examine the stylistic choices incorporating the visual language of comic books, begin to notice a pattern of recurring themes related to loveless marriages and disturbed children, and try to shake the dead eyes of Spencer Treat Clark.</description>

Similar to their investigation of George Lucas’ Star Wars, the hosts aim to discover where exactly in Shyamalan’s filmography did this artist lose touch with his unique vision and become the “twist” guy?&#13;
&#13;
Starting with 1992’s Praying with Anger (set in India and filmed while he was still a student at NYU), as well as, his first major-motion picture Wide Awake, join the hosts as they try to understand how these early attempts would affect his future films and the recurring themes Shyamalan would continue to explore.</description>

  <description>In 1978, CBS aired a two-hour Star Wars holiday special. Only a year prior, A New Hope had been released to critical success and with the Empire Strikes Back in production and to be released in a year and half, this was Lucasfilm’s opportunity to keep fans engaged with the franchise (and sell some merchandise of course) by developing a science fiction variety special using everyones favorite characters.&#13;
&#13;
But it was terrible! So much so, that it has never been re-aired or made available for purchase ever. Nor should it be. Even George hates it, famously saying “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of the show and smash it.”&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David, joined by Pilot Viruet (Flavorwire) discuss this truly insane piece of television history. Together, they examine a storyline involving Chewbacca and Han Solo trying to return to Kasyyyk to celebrate Life Day, a Wookie holiday, Chewbaca’s weird family and extended grunting, the first introduction to Boba Fett, bad french circus dancing, 1970’s cocaine use and so much more!</description>

Only a year prior, A New Hope had been released to critical success and with the Empire Strikes Back in production and to be released in a year and half, this was Lucasfilm’s opportunity to keep fans engaged with the franchise (and sell some merchandise of course) by developing a science fiction variety special using everyones favorite characters.&#13;
&#13;
But it was terrible! So much so, that it has never been re-aired or made available for purchase ever. Nor should it be. Even George hates it, famously saying “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of the show and smash it.”&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David, joined by Pilot Viruet (Flavorwire) discuss this truly insane piece of television history. Together, they examine a storyline involving Chewbacca and Han Solo trying to return to Kasyyyk to celebrate Life Day, a Wookie holiday, Chewbaca’s weird family and extended grunting, the first introduction to Boba Fett, bad french circus dancing, 1970’s cocaine use and so much more!</itunes:summary>

  <description>One day after the release opening of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (SPOILER ALERT!), Griffin and David discussed their impressions on the first installment of the newly revamped franchise. Together, they examine the film’s similar story structure to A New Hope, who would take new characters Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and protagonist Rey out on a classy dinner date, Kylo Ren being an evil nerd and why director J.J. Abrams accomplished where George Lucas had failed with the prequels: making an actual Star Wars movie.</description>

  <description>This week Griffin and David complete their performance reviews of the Phantom Menace trilogy with special guest Chris Gethard (The Chris Gethard Show, Iron Man 3). Together they examine Revenge of the Sith’s entire cast and rate all the *major players–actor by actor. From unanimous MVP Ben Cooke as Kit Fisto to Jimmy Smits' portrayal of Senator Bail Organa getting a soft pass for “taking the girl” to why Silas Caron as Ki-Adi-Mundi (in one of his duel roles) kills it before being murdered and SO MUCH MORE! SERIOUSLY IT’S ALOT!&#13;
&#13;
How does this exhaustive in-depth look compare to some of the actor’s rankings from the previous films? What line of dialogue is David Bowers best known for? What exactly is a salty ol’ space dog?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Chris offers new (and controversial) perspectives on the trilogy/NBA comparisons, justification for background players being good or bad and the many reasons why everyone hates General Grievous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*Much of the cast discussed have seconds of total screen time!?</description>

  <description>The year was 2005. George Lucas returned with the third (and final) film in the Star Wars series: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Again, taking in the criticism from the previous two productions, has the director finally found a focus? Is this a good conclusion to the Phantom Menace series?&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David begin their investigation with the opening battle sequence. And as is tradition of stunning off screen action, the movie starts at the END of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are in space fighters, R2D2 is basically Inspector Gadget now and every 45 seconds a new droid is introduced with the intention of later being merchandised. Also, we meet new characters General Grievous (the limping, coughing leader of the droid army) and a surfer Gungan. Plus, discover Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by Count Dooku (who may have lost his head.) Join your hosts in this week’s episode as they try to take it all in.</description>

  <description>In 1992, the original Fantastic Four movie was produced by Constantin Film solely to retain the rights of the franchise. Shot in 22 days, the low budget film was never to be officially released (unbenounced to the crew and the mostly Canadian cast.)&#13;
&#13;
Fast forward to early aughts and superhero films are all the rage. 20th Century Fox having acquired the licensing, after years of numerous scripts being thrown around, finally begin production on the second Fantastic Four movie in 2004. Though considered a failure among critics and fans, box office sales proved enough for 2007’s sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer. Again, it was not good.&#13;
&#13;
But then in 2015 a reboot directed by Josh Trank was released among rumors of fighting and reshoots and guess what guys IT’S ALSO BAD!&#13;
&#13;
In this week’s special episode, join hosts Griffin and David as they discuss and rank all four films and why this may be the end for Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm).&#13;

<p>But then in 2015 a reboot directed by Josh Trank was released among rumors of fighting and reshoots and guess what guys IT’S ALSO BAD!</p>

<p>In this week’s special episode, join hosts Griffin and David as they discuss and rank all four films and why this may be the end for Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm).</p>

  <description>Griffin and David welcome another amazing guest this week, Chase Mitchell (The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon). Together, they discuss deleted scenes like: Anakin hanging out with Padmé’s father (who is some bum), Jocasta Nu may have had a fling with Count Doku and the Galactic Senate discussing the option to militarize or “the Binks bill.”&#13;
&#13;
Griffin also reads more fan fiction this time about Dexter’s diner (OK and maybe a erotic scene between Anakin and Padmé). Plus, the gang shares their final thoughts on the film.&#13;
&#13;
Is it another case solved? Did they reach any kind of conclusions? Is there some kind of huge revelation exposed in this episode? Listen and find out all these answers and more!&#13;

&#13;
Together, they examine the process of pre-visualization, why the CGI technology of its time compared even with today’s still makes this film ambitious, the uncanny valley and reasons why most of the special effects didn’t enhance or contribute to the overall story.&#13;
&#13;
Though, George tried his best, why did Lucas put himself into a situation where no one could help him or this movie? Why did actors perform to no one in a blue room? Was there ever even a bigger picture or cohesive plan? Find out these answers and more!</description>

From Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi as most improved to Christopher Lee killing it as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus to the amazing voice acting of Ron Falk as THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE: DEXTER JETTSTER!&#13;
&#13;
How do the boys rankings of some actors compare to the last review? Do their critiques take into account the once again overwhelming criticism that revolved around this film?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, assessing director’s body of work such as Joel Schumacher, apparently Michael Jackson wanted to be Jar Jar Binks and remember thespians don’t blink!</description>

  <description>Well he’s a teenager now: not in control of his emotions, hormone fueled, and in desperate need of discipline/a good spanking! So what does the Jedi council do? Well they put young Anakin in charge of protecting Padmé!&#13;
&#13;
You mean, an important Galactic Senator with multiple attempts on her life being guarded by a Padawan that is recognized as being a bit of a wild card? Sure what could go wrong?&#13;
&#13;

  <description>It was a dark and stormy night on planet Kamino. Detective Kenobi was far far away from home. He wondered to himself in the rain: why did Sifo-Dyas place an order for a clone army 10 years ago? Why was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett chosen as the clone specimen? Who deleted Kamino from the archives?&#13;
&#13;
And then the film goes on to answer none of these questions.&#13;
&#13;
This week Griffin and David look at the Obi-Wan Kenobi space noir story line, including, meeting 50’s diner purveyor and forensics expert Dexter Jettster, Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu, and discuss at length the logistics of a planet that specializes in cloning.</description>

  <description>The year was 2002. It had been 3 years since the Phantom Menace. George Lucas returned with his second Star Wars release: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. But did ol’ George learn his lesson and adjust to some of the issues that critics and fans had with the previous film? Is there a clear answer to what this movie is about? Who are the clones and what are they attacking?&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David (having discovered this sequel) are excited to return to their investigation, and in this week’s episode, they dive back in looking at the first 25 minutes. Join your hosts as they get reintroduced to Padmé, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jar Jar Binks and a now grown up Anakin Skywalker, discuss the assassinations attempts, why Anakin has become such a jerk and what message Lucas has inserted in the film in regards to smoking cigarettes AKA ‘death sticks.’ Also, should Griffin’s merch spotlight continue as a segment and #PadmeDolezalYesOrNo?</description>

  <description>One year ago acclaimed actors Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall appeared together in the film The Judge. The movie is about a big city lawyer returning to his childhood home where his father, the town’s judge, is suspected of killing someone after running them over. It was directed by David Dobkin, was the first feature release from “Team Downey,” Robert and wife Susan’s production company AND Duvall even received a Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. It must be great.&#13;
&#13;
No it’s a steaming pile of garbage.&#13;
&#13;
You the fans did not ask for it, but in this week’s special episode hosts Griffin and David judged the Judge. Together, they discuss at length the trajectory of RDJ’s career and what lead him to turn down roles in Gravity, Oz the Great and Powerful and Inherent Vice to produce and star in the Judge, why Dobkin thinks he’s funny and why possible incest is always a great sign for drama.&#13;

  <description>Toys. Kids love them. And so do Griffin and David.&#13;
&#13;
This movie’s entire production was funded by the sale of exclusive rights to the merchandising. And manufacturer Hasbro, pulled out all the stops including introducing technology that allowed the products to “talk like never before,” capturing some of the most exciting moments in toy form like a seated Jabba the Hutt watching the pod race along with color commentators Fode and Beeb, and a product (made for children) that allows someone to suck on Jar Jar Bink’s candy tongue.&#13;
&#13;
So join your hosts to find out whats in Watto’s box, does Griffin buy something on Ebay he will regret and a look back at their younger selves to REMEMBER THE TOYS.</description>

  <description>This week Griffin and David delve into the character we all know and love: Jar Jar Binks. How does an outcast of the Gungan society go on to save his people? The answer might just be tasteless comedy and a dash of racism.&#13;
&#13;
Would Jar Jar Binks’ character be less offensive if developed as a noble savage rather than a goof that exclusively speaks in broken english? Did George Lucas really think he was gonna get away with it? Remember Jar Jar is for kids, right?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the Jar Jar Binks Pez “handler” and why Gragra is more deserving of our attention.&#13;
&#13;
And dear listeners, if you have your own theory on what the Phantom Menace is really about, please send an audio recording  explanation (1-3 mins) to griffinanddavidpresent@gmail.com and it might get played on an upcoming episode!</description>

  <description>In the fifth installment of the only podcast that exclusively talks about the Phantom Menace, Griffin and David look to the movie’s cast and rate all the major players–actor by actor. From finding Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi weak to Natalie Portman performance as the split roles of Queen Amidala/Padmé not horrible (and she goes on to future successes okay!) to even Tony award winning Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine just really having fun and bringing it. Also, Poor poor Jake Lloyd.&#13;
&#13;
How do the boys rankings reflect on the film overall? Does their critiques live up to the overwhelming criticism that revolves around this movie?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin’s chance encounter with Liam Neeson, who brings an authority called for in the role as Qui-Gon Jinn and has got gravitas for days.</description>

  <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is host of the George Lucas Talk Show, Connor Ratliff, to discuss the commentary special feature included with the initial DVD release of the Phantom Menace. Together they review what members of the production crew (including director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, sound designer Ben Burtt, animation director Rob Coleman and more) have to say about the filming of this movie and discover new evidence of what went wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Do we agree Phantom is like the act one of a play or should the focus have been on making a better stand alone movie? Why is revealing that 85% of the dialogue had to be ADR or reshooting 45 more minutes of footage a year later after principal photography not embarrassing? Could Phantom hold up as a silent film?&#13;
&#13;
Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights Pepsi collectable soda cans and the golden Yoda, Connor’s fake Phantom Menace rumors that make it to Spin magazine and what is the best joke in the film.</description>

Their ongoing investigation reveals new insights into many aspects of these robed street people, including: explaining the ridiculousness of midichlorians, the poorly designed “revolving-restaurant” headquarters, and why love is forbidden for all Jedi.&#13;

&#13;
This week Griffin and David look at Queen Amidala and the history of the royalty of Naboo. Why was actress Natalie Portman widely trashed for her performance in this movie? With the complicated costumes, the extravagant hair, the memorable make up, was it the strange choice to speak like a Canadian from South Park? Was Keira Knightley acting as Queen Amidala’s double supposed to be a surprise? These questions and more are answered in our next installment.&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the separately sold hyperdrive repair kit and the boys restate their hypothesis: Was if this movie is about Trade Regulations?</description>

  <description>The year was 1999. It had been twenty-two years since George Lucas last directed a feature film. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was highly anticipated. But then why did the majority of audiences and critics hate it so much?&#13;
&#13;
Sixteen years later, Griffin and David started this podcast with one question in mind: &quot;what is The Phantom Menace REALLY about?&quot; Here in their debut episode, the hosts set out to do just that by beginning their investigation with the first eight minutes of the movie. Join them as we meet Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn and protegé Obi-Wan Kenobi, the very sexual TC-14, learn about the trade federation and get some insight into how a fourteen year old girl could be elected queen of a planet. Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the CommTech Communicator that made action figures talk.</description>
