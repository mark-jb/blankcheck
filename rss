  <description>Man wouldn't it be weird to have a future controlled by a rich blond bully who hates women, steals things and is awful to everyone? Robert Zemeckis predicts a wild, kooky, and somewhat accurate 2015 with Back to the Future Part II. Comedian Nicole Byer (Nailed It, Newcomers (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/newcomers-lord-rings-lauren-lapkus-nicole-byer/id1494534953) , Why Won't You Date Me (https://headgum.com/why-wont-you-date-me-with-nicole-byer) ) helps us make sense of the different timelines, unpack the connection to Trump, analyze the film’s strategic approach to the sequel and the ultimate disappointment that hoverboards continue to not exist.

  <description>A noir for kids. Disney and Warner Bros characters together for the first and last time. Live action drama with kooky Tex Avery-style animation. There's really no movie quite like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. How long did &quot;bumping the lamp&quot; take? What's a contemporary take on Jessica and Roger Rabbit's relationship dynamics? How does the film's story mirror Hollywood? We invited the Doughboys themselves, Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger to help us find out!

  <description>It was the #1 film of 1985. It’s a theme park ride. An animated series. It spawned video games. Comic books. Musicals. It’s in the goddamn Library of Congress! And key to this series, it guaranteed Robert Zemeckis big crazy budgets for decades. Has there ever been a bigger “blank check&quot; than Back to the Future? Now make like a tree and start the episode already!

We invited Filmspotting (https://www.filmspotting.net/) ’s Adam Kempenaar and Josh Larsen to dive into Zemeckis’ first commercial success and how it set the tone for a decade of hits.

  <description>In The Old Guard (2020), Charlize Theron, Kiki Layne, and a group of immortal warriors define why it's worth living to fight another day. Plus they look extremely cool doing it. This week, we wrap up Gina Prince-Bythewood's series with her most recent film, released on Netflix mid-pandemic. How has 2020 affected the release and how we watch it (preferably from a porch)? What do we want to see out of a sequel? What's the best Netflix movie formula? Join Griffin, David and Ben as we list our favorite Prince-Blythwood movies and what blank checks we're looking forward to in the future.

  <description>It’s rare we get to start a mini-series with a classic. 20 years after its release, Gina Prince-Bythewood’s directorial debut still stands the test of time as a top-tier cinematic love story. This week’s all about Love and Basketball (2000), which would set the tone for her career. But what’s the story that led her there? Carl Tart (The Good Place, Comedy Bang Bang) joins as we discuss how Sanaa Lathan fought for her big break, the impact of seeing a romance between two Black leads on the big screen (and VHS), and confuse Griffin with WNBA and NBA stats.

  <description>The friends are joined by Search Party director Charles Rogers to discuss this mixed bag of mixed messages of a Christmas movie that shows maybe Norah Ephron can't do black comedies. Don't worry if you haven't seen it, because this is mostly an extensive discussion about Steve Martin's career, Liev Schreiber being great in drag, and the Sondheim musical Assassins.

Check out  Search Party Season 3 (https://www.hbomax.com/sp?utm_id=sa%7c71700000068498215%7c58700006069882428%7cp54907110273&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4u_squmd6gIVoAiICR1kswrFEAAYASAAEgIwpfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) on HBO Max, RIGHT NOW!

  <description>Only Nora Ephron could make a rom-com where the leads interact for 2 minutes an instant classic. The BC crew makes a Tom and Meg inspired long distance call to Katey Rich (Vanity Fair) for Ephron's sophomore hit, Sleepless in Seattle (1993). We get into how rom-coms have risen and fallen, the lure of cool boat houses, and the enigma that is Chet Hanks.

  <description>It laid the groundwork for her entire film career. It set the mold for every rom-com that followed. Though it wasn’t her directorial debut, you just don’t do Nora Ephron without covering When Harry Met Sally. We invited Slate critic and podcast host Dana Stevens (Culture Gabfest, Flashback) to discuss the 1989 classic and ask the big questions. How is Billy Crystal so damn charming? Which Meg Ryan hairstyle is best? And most importantly...can men and women be friends???

  <description>Who is 1998's Babe: Pig in the City for? Is it for kids? Stoners? Four grown adults attempting to navigate a national pandemic? This is the question Travis McElroy (My Brother, My Brother and Me, Adventure Zone, Run: A Doctor Who Fancast) poses to the BC crew this week. We defend and analyze another George Miller death city, robot chimp babies, and why Siskel went out on a high note. That'll do.

  <description>Hard to believe we're already halfway through our George Miller series! This week Bilge Ebiri (Vulture) returns to talk about one of his favorite films, 1992's Lorenzo's Oil. Starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte...with an Italian accent that somehow works...Oil may have disappointed at the box office but still got a screenplay and best actress Oscar nomination. Turns out medical dramas really work when they're made by actual doctors...who happen to be as talented as George Miller.

  <description>Who? Weekly hosts Bobby Finger and Lindsey Weber talk about Demme's last film, written by Diablo Cody. But they really just want to talk about Tully. It's a film about dead beat [get it? BEAT??] Moms with Meryl's real daughter, and Griffin is so laid back he has his microphone in his lap. What works for Wild Rose that doesn't work for this film? Can we talk about her INSANE TATTOO FOR A SECOND? And what's the best place to watch this movie?

  <description>David, Griffin, and self-made man of letters John Hodgman (https://twitter.com/hodgman) have to deal with Ragnar in this weird weird weird adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play - and by adaptation, we mean they just took the play and filmed it in a house in Nyack. But instead of talking about the not so great film, get ready for more rants about Cars 2 (WHAT IS MONEY HOW DOES THIS WORK?) and the explanation of how Playmobil the Movie happened without anyone noticing. Also, in no way was this episode accidentally deleted and hastily re-recorded at the last minute.

  <description>Director and filmmaker David Lowery joins the two friends to talk about a weird remake of an Audrey Hepburn movie, except bad, starring Mark Wahlberg in his self-described worst role. There are insane hat choices and a very long ballroom scene. What was the last video game that Lowery played? Why is Tom Cruise wearing Ugg boot? How does Ted Levine die?  And what film did Lowry review and later realize he hadn't actually seen? THIS MOVIE HONKS!

  <description>Everyone wants to get to the pod with guest Demi Adejuyigbe, where The Blank Check Boys talk about Demme's Concert Film with the Talking Heads. What shows should get gritty reboots? Why did concert films stop existing?  What is the song Heaven about (what isn't it about?) Have you seen DJ Khaled's Slack channel? And what would David Byrne sound like ordering a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese? One of the great things is that there's no talking heads about the Talking Heads, it's just a great show.

  <description>Finally, we get to the good Demme movies with film critic Jordan Hoffman. (https://jordanhoffman.com/) The partially true story of a guy who thinks Howard Hughes is gonna leave him money. What made Griffin almost cry (and not in frustration)? What is an animated movie actually and is it for children? What game shows attracted the weirdest contestants. Why isn't there a good movie where someone's telling someone to go get their shine box? And what's your favorite Airplane joke?

  <description>Guest Justin McElroy (https://www.themcelroy.family/) is gonna be mad he volunteered to do any film when Griff and David talk about Demme's first two tries at &quot;real&quot; movies after his Roger Korman saga. The trio talk about CB, or &quot;Citizen's Band,&quot; and Last Embrace, a surprisingly Judaic Thriller. The films contain oddly touching birthday party scenes, IMDB spoilers,  children named Blood, and the introduction of heavy concepts that are never dealt with. Did Ben Kingsley win an Oscar?  What's Justin's 30-second Tim Robbins story? Also what is Mandy Patinkin, the Patinkiest, doing in this movie?

  <description>It’s the first episode of a new mini-series. You voted for him, you’ve only yourself to blame for JONATHAN DEMME. Probably one of the directors with the most range of films - from rom coms to serious dramas - Griffin and David start with the first three of his films, each a strange genre movie: Caged Heat about a prison break; Crazy Mama about women doing crimes; and Fighting Mad which pits farmers vs coal companies. What is the appeal of women’s prison movies? Literally what is Michael Richards doing all day? Can art be non-political nowadays? And what exactly makes Demme SO iconic that he’s such an influencer?

  <description>This week, Chris Cabin and Eric Szyszka of the We Hate Movies podcast (http://www.whmpodcast.com/) joins Griffin and David to discuss the original Hannibal Lecter film: 1986's Manhunter. But what motivated producer Dino De Laurentiis to scrap the adapted title Red Dragon in favor of Manhunter? Did Michael Mann's research involve becoming pen pals with an incarcerated murderer? Is poet and painter William Blake's Great Red Dragon on fleek? Together they examine the performances of William Petersen and Brian Cox, the work of novelist Thomas Harris and the complete Lecter-verse (including Hannibal Rising), Walt Disney’s frozen head and serial killer home design aesthetics.

  <description>Richard Lawson returns to discuss the late-Burton effort: 2014's Big Eyes. But why are the eyes so big? Should Christoph Waltz be the star of his own network TV sitcom? How did Burton pull off making the focus of this movie about the main character's abuser?

  <description>Blank Check continues its mini-series covering the films of director Tim Burton with the alien invasion comedy, Mars Attacks!

Does David have a half-sister, and if so, why has she never been mentioned before? Joined by comedian, Paul F. Tompkins (BoJack Horsman), they discuss the various performances of this stacked ensemble cast, the unusual billing, face goop, Entourage the movie and extreme Burton stereotypes such as happy suburban people and haunted ghost children.

  <description>Comedian, writer and actor Jamie Lee (HBO's Crashing) joins Griffin and David to discuss Meyers’ most recent offering, 2015’s The Intern. But what was Griffin and Jamie’s experience auditioning for this movie? Why is the husband so lame and unlikable? Is there a bombshell in this edition of Romilly’s Kitchen Corner?

  <description>Writer, Fran Hoepfner joins Griffin and David to discuss 2006’s house swap rom-com, The Holiday. But Is foreplay really overrated? Was John Krasinski in The Holiday the Adam Driver of Lincoln of 2006? Is Garden State the most iconic New Jersey movie because they go to Medieval Times and yell at a ditch? Together, they examine the careers of Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and Jude “Daddy” Law; Christmas in England; loving movie scores enough to make gibberish sounds in public places and Venom being SO rude.

  <description>Blank it, thank it! J.D. Amato (The President Show) returns, in the last episode of our mini series devoted to the filmography of director Ang Lee, to discuss 2016’s high frame rate Iraq War drama, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. But what makes this movie so revolutionary? What is the evolution of frame rates in film? Who are the shortest and the tallest actors according to IMDB? Together they examine the history of cameras from film to digital, the BIG3 basketball league and never doing an episode on The Happytime Murders. This episode is sponsored by [Away](https://www.awaytravel.com/check) CODE: CHECK, [Brooklinen](https://www.brooklinen.com/) CODE: CHECK and HowStuffWorks’ [The Soundtrack Show](https://www.soundtrackpodcast.com/).

  <description>This week Blank Check begins a new mini series reviewing the filmography of director Brad Bird with a discussion of 1999’s critically acclaimed animated feature, The Iron Giant. But does the Iron Giant wear a shirt? Did the studio request this movie be set in present day and have a hip hop soundtrack? Should Griffin and David fight more? Together, in their worst episode ever, they examine Brad Bird’s origin story, the hotness of Harry Connick Jr. as beatnik industrial artist Dean McCoppin, the upcoming Blank Check Pictures slate and booger stores.</description>

  <description>In the final episode of our mini series devoted to the filmography of James L. Brooks, Griffin and David discuss the disastrous 2010 film How Do You Know. But why would Brooks at this moment in history sympathize with the business executives being held accountable for their corporate malfeasance? What does it mean when referring to a scene as a steam room? And also how do you know? Together they examine the careers of Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson, the Australian word for ‘grogan,’ and the 120 million dollar budget.

  <description>Richard Lawson (author of All We Can Do Is Wait) returns to discuss 2004’s Spanglish. But is this movie really about James L. Brooks attempting to justify why he wants to sleep with his maid? Is it believable a character has never seen a man cry? Is this film available on blu-ray and will it’s value increase over time like bitcoins? Together they examine Adam Sandler’s career, Téa Leoni’s VERY big performance, using monologues from Spanglish for auditioning and birthdays at a themed restaurant called Mars 2112\. This episode is sponsored by Brooklinen (PROMO: CHECK) and WeTransfer.

  <description>James L. Brooks had originally shot I’ll Do Anything as a musical. But in the test screening it was so disastrous the studio insisted he cut all the musical sequences out and reshoot new scenes to fill it in. Having reviewed that theatrical cut, Griffin and David revisit this film with returning guest Esther Zuckerman and discuss the lost, coveted musical cut of I’ll Do Anything in a special bonus episode. But what would the child of Albert Brooks and Julie Kavner sound like? Why does Griffin insist on singing the horrid song “You Are The Best?” Is this episode haunted? Together they go through all the musical numbers and try to decide if this version of the movie makes it any less worse.</description>

  <description>Writer and friend of the show Esther Zuckerman joins Griffin and David to discuss 1994’s I'll Do Anything. But was this film originally developed and shot as a musical only to be reedited into a mostly non-musical? Were prolific musicians Prince, Sinéad O'Connor and Carole King brought on to write the songs for this movie? Did Nick Nolte really win People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive in 1992? Together they examine the inside baseball dealings of Hollywood, the bad 90’s fashion, honest curses and comedic frontal nudity.

Is this a successful satire of French erotic thrillers according to Griffin’s Mom? Can the video game being designed in the movie be at all entertaining?

  <description>Writer/director Alex Ross Perry (Nostalgia, Golden Exits) returns to Blank Check to discuss 2000’s invisible sci-fi slasher, Hollow Man. But why is this not your grandfather’s invisible man movie? What was the running Joey Slotnick bit on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn? Does this film lack the satire and point of view of Verhoven’s past movies? Together they discuss the career trajectory of Kevin Bacon, poorly executed Tarantino-esque schoolyard jokes, the original Dark Universe of the 1990s and why this film’s poor reception caused Verhoeven to retreat back to the Netherlands. This episode is sponsored by Serial Box - False Idols and Audible.</description>

Together they discuss 1990’s _twisted_ sci-fi thriller, Total Recall. But how much creative control did Arnold have over this film? What is Michael Ironside actual first name? Are all the Johnny cabs designed so that if a passenger skips on the fare the robot driver’s head explodes? Their conversation includes peak practical effects, Robert Costanzo playing himself in the film and if the story that unfolds is in fact all just a dream.

Is it true that Verhoeven initially read half a page of the script and threw in the trash only to have his wife retrieve it and encourage him to give it a second chance? Together they examine the construction and evolution of the RoboCop costume, breaking squib records, 1987’s Academy award winners and many other tangents.

Already an accomplished filmmaker in the Netherlands, 1985 marked his American debut with the unpleasantly realistic period piece, Flesh+Blood. But how gross was the medieval times? What was the influence of growing up under Nazi occupation on Verhoeven’s worldview? Is it intended for the viewer to root for the plague? Together, Griffin and David discuss his original Dutch movies, Bosch paintings, and how Flesh+Blood’s failure at the box office would inform his study of American culture and his future films.</description>

  <description>Live from the 19th annual Del Close Marathon in New York City, Peter Serafinowicz (The Tick) joins Griffin and David for a serious conversation about Peter’s role as the voice of Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. This special episode marks a return to the podcast’s early days as exclusively a Star Wars prequels podcast. But what was Peter’s approach to prepare for 4 lines of voice over dialogue?

  <description>Joe Garden (The Onion) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss the mo-cap animated action/mystery, The Adventures of Tintin.

  <description>David Ehrlich (IndieWire) returns to Blank Check to discuss 2008's polarized franchise reboot, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But are the rumors true that there is a superior early version of this screenplay? Is George Lucas to blame for the most of the criticism? And is it clear that Mutt Williams is a greaser type character? Together they examine, the new old Harrison Ford movies slated for release, the culture around the death of celebrities, the many follies of Shia LaBeouf and also explore Ray Winstone impressions.</description>

The topic of discussion: 2004’s stranded at the airport dramedy The Terminal. But exactly how much Stanley Tucci does a movie need? What was behind the absurd Michael Douglas cancer story? Is it clear where exactly is Krakozhia? Together, Griffin, David and Jerah examine Catherine Zeta-Jones’ career trajectory, jazz photos, Shrek 3, saltine cracker sandwiches and more. Plus, Jerah shares a personal account of being trapped in the airport and Producer Ben is hungover AF.</description>

Together they examine the career trajectory of Matthew McConaughey, Peter Firth receives comedy points and assess the cast in a performance review.</description>

  <description>The debut of our new mini series on the filmography of Steven Spielberg begins with 1997’s Lost World: Jurassic Park. Post-Oscar wins for Best Director and Best Picture, Steven took four years off before directing this sequel. In that time he founded his own studio DreamWorks. Griffin and David would argue this level of creative control is the biggest blank check that any filmmaker has ever had. Presenting Pod Me If You Cast.&#13;
&#13;
But seriously what IS chaos math? Why does this film unfold similarly to a video game? What does Isla Nublar roughly translate to?&#13;
&#13;
Together #thetwofriends discuss the careers of Laura Dern, Vince Vaughn, Jeff Goldblum, convenient islands, life finding a way and a epic Pete Postlethwaite monologue.</description>

In it’s 84 minute runtime are there more fish or people spawning?

  <description>Griffin, David and guest host Producer Ben present a special episode this week: a discussion of 1995’s action thriller Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.&#13;
&#13;
But is it true the co-founder of CAA and former Disney president, Michael Ovitz, bet he could make even a stocky Aikido teacher with zero acting experience a star? Does Hollywood make these b-list midsize action movies anymore? Is Steven Seagal our quietest action hero?&#13;
&#13;
Together the trio examines New Zealand director and journeyman Geoff Murphy’s career, Eric Bogosian’s performance as the scientist gone bad, earthquake inducing satellites sponsored by the U.S. government and the original song written AND performed by Steven Seagal “After the Train Has Gone.” Plus, share a Hamilton themed Burger Report, review Star Trek Beyond and what occupations Nic Cage said he would like to portray.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, remember dear listener that after this week’s palette cleanser Blank Check will return with our new mini series covering the films of James Cameron!</description>

Together, they examine making out with Paul Giamatti, various grunge musician cameos, “super” trains and terrible 90’s fashion.

  <description>This week Griffin and David discuss the Wachowski’s most recent theatrical release, 2015’s intergalactic sci-fi, Jupiter Ascending. What is the Wachowski’s latest innovation in this film? Why make the very attractive Channing Tatum look like a dog? Is the original universe in this story at all logical? Listen along as they discuss space rollerblades, the parallel with Alice in Wonderland, Terry Gilliam’s costuming and Eddie Redmayne’s outstanding performance as the whispering villain Balem Abrasax.

&lt;p&gt;Starting with 1996’s Bound, join the hosts as they discuss the greatness of Joey Pants, remembering the 90’s, Gina Gershon and the Sam Simon connection, plus why cell phones have ruined cinema.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description>Louis Peitzman (BuzzFeed) joins Griffin and David to discuss the old person horror, 2015’s The Visit. But is the found footage device used in a effective way? Can the great Kathryn Hahn do no wrong? Does this mean M. Night’s very bad movie streak has finally run out? Together they examine the Blumhouse model, the gross factor versus the gore factor, a dirty diaper in the face and how Shyamalan paying out of pocket for this production might just correlate with it being actually palatable. Also, the original Slenderman, lil Roman Polanski rapping, and a Burger Report with LeBron James.</description>

  <description>James III (Black Men Can’t Jump In Hollywood Podcast) joins Griffin and David to discuss the incredibly dull, thinly veiled Scientology sci-fi, 2013’s After Earth. Beyond starring along side his son Jaden and being credited as a producer and original story writer, how else did Will Smith play a role in the making of this film? Does the timing of After Earth’s release have anything to do with Jaden’s emancipation from his parents? Is it possible for M. Night to ever work again after 5 sequential critical and commercial failures? Together they examine Will’s illustrious career up to After Earth, the development of Jaden’s stardom, having emotion, giving your monsters the ability to see and the duality of what is happening in this movie is happening in real life.</description>

When adapting the the original animated series, why did M. Night try to incorporate ALL 20 episodes of the first season into one movie? How do the casting choices reflect negatively on the film? Was Last Airbender so terrible that the BC crew in this episode talks about basically anything else? Yes, yes it is. Together, they examine the artist’s quest and how to avoid making your ‘Last Airbender,’ this being the first film Griffin ever auditioned for, on set stories for Chris Rock’s Top Five and Seaton meeting Woody Allen.</description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On this week’s special episode, Griffin and David joined by guest, Joe Reid (The Decider), present their personal nominations for the upcoming 88th Academy Awards. This roundtable discussion looks to all the major categories and offers engaging criticism, as well as, references deep cut cinema from 2015 you may have missed. With the “Blankies”, some winners are picked, Oscar snubs deservingly defended, but as always most of the personal grudges continue. Also, Griffin reads a listener submitted Star Wars/Blank Check crossover fan fiction titled: “Fisto and the Hoz” and Producer Ben offers up some of his own original categories.

  <description>Matt Patches (Thrillist, Grantland) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss Shyamalan’s fourth feature, Unbreakable. This sad and muted superhero film where mostly nothing happens was seen by many critics and fans as a “sophomore slump” when released in 2000. But what are some of it’s redeeming qualities? How does it stand out among the Marvel superhero movie craze in the years that followed?&#13;
&#13;
Oh and is there a twist you ask? Well listen along as the gang unpacks the making and reception of Unbreakable, together examine the stylistic choices incorporating the visual language of comic books, begin to notice a pattern of recurring themes related to loveless marriages and disturbed children, and try to shake the dead eyes of Spencer Treat Clark.</description>

  <description>In the debut episode of the newly rebranded ‘Blank Check’, Griffin and David look to another director of supersized ego and skill: M. Night Shyamalan. Similar to their investigation of George Lucas’ Star Wars, the hosts aim to discover where exactly in Shyamalan’s filmography did this artist lose touch with his unique vision and become the “twist” guy?&#13;
&#13;
Starting with 1992’s Praying with Anger (set in India and filmed while he was still a student at NYU), as well as, his first major-motion picture Wide Awake, join the hosts as they try to understand how these early attempts would affect his future films and the recurring themes Shyamalan would continue to explore.</description>

  <description>In 1978, CBS aired a two-hour Star Wars holiday special. Only a year prior, A New Hope had been released to critical success and with the Empire Strikes Back in production and to be released in a year and half, this was Lucasfilm’s opportunity to keep fans engaged with the franchise (and sell some merchandise of course) by developing a science fiction variety special using everyones favorite characters.&#13;
&#13;
But it was terrible! So much so, that it has never been re-aired or made available for purchase ever. Nor should it be. Even George hates it, famously saying “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of the show and smash it.”&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David, joined by Pilot Viruet (Flavorwire) discuss this truly insane piece of television history. Together, they examine a storyline involving Chewbacca and Han Solo trying to return to Kasyyyk to celebrate Life Day, a Wookie holiday, Chewbaca’s weird family and extended grunting, the first introduction to Boba Fett, bad french circus dancing, 1970’s cocaine use and so much more!</description>

  <description>This week Griffin and David complete their performance reviews of the Phantom Menace trilogy with special guest Chris Gethard (The Chris Gethard Show, Iron Man 3). Together they examine Revenge of the Sith’s entire cast and rate all the *major players–actor by actor. From unanimous MVP Ben Cooke as Kit Fisto to Jimmy Smits' portrayal of Senator Bail Organa getting a soft pass for “taking the girl” to why Silas Caron as Ki-Adi-Mundi (in one of his duel roles) kills it before being murdered and SO MUCH MORE! SERIOUSLY IT’S ALOT!&#13;
&#13;
How does this exhaustive in-depth look compare to some of the actor’s rankings from the previous films? What line of dialogue is David Bowers best known for? What exactly is a salty ol’ space dog?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Chris offers new (and controversial) perspectives on the trilogy/NBA comparisons, justification for background players being good or bad and the many reasons why everyone hates General Grievous.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
*Much of the cast discussed have seconds of total screen time!?</description>

  <description>The year was 2005. George Lucas returned with the third (and final) film in the Star Wars series: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Again, taking in the criticism from the previous two productions, has the director finally found a focus? Is this a good conclusion to the Phantom Menace series?&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David begin their investigation with the opening battle sequence. And as is tradition of stunning off screen action, the movie starts at the END of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are in space fighters, R2D2 is basically Inspector Gadget now and every 45 seconds a new droid is introduced with the intention of later being merchandised. Also, we meet new characters General Grievous (the limping, coughing leader of the droid army) and a surfer Gungan. Plus, discover Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by Count Dooku (who may have lost his head.) Join your hosts in this week’s episode as they try to take it all in.</description>

  <description>In 1992, the original Fantastic Four movie was produced by Constantin Film solely to retain the rights of the franchise. Shot in 22 days, the low budget film was never to be officially released (unbenounced to the crew and the mostly Canadian cast.)&#13;
&#13;
Fast forward to early aughts and superhero films are all the rage. 20th Century Fox having acquired the licensing, after years of numerous scripts being thrown around, finally begin production on the second Fantastic Four movie in 2004. Though considered a failure among critics and fans, box office sales proved enough for 2007’s sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer. Again, it was not good.&#13;
&#13;
But then in 2015 a reboot directed by Josh Trank was released among rumors of fighting and reshoots and guess what guys IT’S ALSO BAD!&#13;
&#13;
In this week’s special episode, join hosts Griffin and David as they discuss and rank all four films and why this may be the end for Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm).&#13;

  <description>Griffin and David welcome another amazing guest this week, Chase Mitchell (The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon). Together, they discuss deleted scenes like: Anakin hanging out with Padmé’s father (who is some bum), Jocasta Nu may have had a fling with Count Doku and the Galactic Senate discussing the option to militarize or “the Binks bill.”&#13;
&#13;
Griffin also reads more fan fiction this time about Dexter’s diner (OK and maybe a erotic scene between Anakin and Padmé). Plus, the gang shares their final thoughts on the film.&#13;
&#13;
Is it another case solved? Did they reach any kind of conclusions? Is there some kind of huge revelation exposed in this episode? Listen and find out all these answers and more!&#13;

Griffin also reads more fan fiction this time about Dexter’s diner (OK and maybe a erotic scene between Anakin and Padmé). Plus, the gang shares their final thoughts on the film.&#13;
&#13;
Is it another case solved? Did they reach any kind of conclusions? Is there some kind of huge revelation exposed in this episode? Listen and find out all these answers and more!&#13;

  <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is special guest J.D. Amato to discuss the behind-the-scenes making of this film, including, a featurette entitled: “Star Wars State Of The Art: The Pre-Visualization Of Episode II” (found in the initial DVD release of Attack of the Clones.)&#13;
&#13;
Together, they examine the process of pre-visualization, why the CGI technology of its time compared even with today’s still makes this film ambitious, the uncanny valley and reasons why most of the special effects didn’t enhance or contribute to the overall story.&#13;
&#13;
Though, George tried his best, why did Lucas put himself into a situation where no one could help him or this movie? Why did actors perform to no one in a blue room? Was there ever even a bigger picture or cohesive plan? Find out these answers and more!</description>

  <description>In the sixth installment of the only podcast that exclusively talks about Attack of the Clones (formally just the Phantom Menace until discovering this sequel), Griffin and David once again examine the film’s entire cast and rate all the major players–actor by actor. From Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi as most improved to Christopher Lee killing it as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus to the amazing voice acting of Ron Falk as THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE: DEXTER JETTSTER!&#13;
&#13;
How do the boys rankings of some actors compare to the last review? Do their critiques take into account the once again overwhelming criticism that revolved around this film?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, assessing director’s body of work such as Joel Schumacher, apparently Michael Jackson wanted to be Jar Jar Binks and remember thespians don’t blink!</description>

  <description>It was a dark and stormy night on planet Kamino. Detective Kenobi was far far away from home. He wondered to himself in the rain: why did Sifo-Dyas place an order for a clone army 10 years ago? Why was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett chosen as the clone specimen? Who deleted Kamino from the archives?&#13;
&#13;
And then the film goes on to answer none of these questions.&#13;
&#13;
This week Griffin and David look at the Obi-Wan Kenobi space noir story line, including, meeting 50’s diner purveyor and forensics expert Dexter Jettster, Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu, and discuss at length the logistics of a planet that specializes in cloning.</description>

  <description>The year was 2002. It had been 3 years since the Phantom Menace. George Lucas returned with his second Star Wars release: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. But did ol’ George learn his lesson and adjust to some of the issues that critics and fans had with the previous film? Is there a clear answer to what this movie is about? Who are the clones and what are they attacking?&#13;
&#13;
Griffin and David (having discovered this sequel) are excited to return to their investigation, and in this week’s episode, they dive back in looking at the first 25 minutes. Join your hosts as they get reintroduced to Padmé, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jar Jar Binks and a now grown up Anakin Skywalker, discuss the assassinations attempts, why Anakin has become such a jerk and what message Lucas has inserted in the film in regards to smoking cigarettes AKA ‘death sticks.’ Also, should Griffin’s merch spotlight continue as a segment and #PadmeDolezalYesOrNo?</description>

  <description>One year ago acclaimed actors Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall appeared together in the film The Judge. The movie is about a big city lawyer returning to his childhood home where his father, the town’s judge, is suspected of killing someone after running them over. It was directed by David Dobkin, was the first feature release from “Team Downey,” Robert and wife Susan’s production company AND Duvall even received a Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. It must be great.&#13;
&#13;
No it’s a steaming pile of garbage.&#13;
&#13;
You the fans did not ask for it, but in this week’s special episode hosts Griffin and David judged the Judge. Together, they discuss at length the trajectory of RDJ’s career and what lead him to turn down roles in Gravity, Oz the Great and Powerful and Inherent Vice to produce and star in the Judge, why Dobkin thinks he’s funny and why possible incest is always a great sign for drama.&#13;

  <description>This week Griffin and David delve into the character we all know and love: Jar Jar Binks. How does an outcast of the Gungan society go on to save his people? The answer might just be tasteless comedy and a dash of racism.&#13;
&#13;
Would Jar Jar Binks’ character be less offensive if developed as a noble savage rather than a goof that exclusively speaks in broken english? Did George Lucas really think he was gonna get away with it? Remember Jar Jar is for kids, right?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the Jar Jar Binks Pez “handler” and why Gragra is more deserving of our attention.&#13;
&#13;
And dear listeners, if you have your own theory on what the Phantom Menace is really about, please send an audio recording  explanation (1-3 mins) to griffinanddavidpresent@gmail.com and it might get played on an upcoming episode!</description>

  <description>In the fifth installment of the only podcast that exclusively talks about the Phantom Menace, Griffin and David look to the movie’s cast and rate all the major players–actor by actor. From finding Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi weak to Natalie Portman performance as the split roles of Queen Amidala/Padmé not horrible (and she goes on to future successes okay!) to even Tony award winning Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine just really having fun and bringing it. Also, Poor poor Jake Lloyd.&#13;
&#13;
How do the boys rankings reflect on the film overall? Does their critiques live up to the overwhelming criticism that revolves around this movie?&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin’s chance encounter with Liam Neeson, who brings an authority called for in the role as Qui-Gon Jinn and has got gravitas for days.</description>

  <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is host of the George Lucas Talk Show, Connor Ratliff, to discuss the commentary special feature included with the initial DVD release of the Phantom Menace. Together they review what members of the production crew (including director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, sound designer Ben Burtt, animation director Rob Coleman and more) have to say about the filming of this movie and discover new evidence of what went wrong.&#13;
&#13;
Do we agree Phantom is like the act one of a play or should the focus have been on making a better stand alone movie? Why is revealing that 85% of the dialogue had to be ADR or reshooting 45 more minutes of footage a year later after principal photography not embarrassing? Could Phantom hold up as a silent film?&#13;
&#13;
Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights Pepsi collectable soda cans and the golden Yoda, Connor’s fake Phantom Menace rumors that make it to Spin magazine and what is the best joke in the film.</description>

  <description>This week Griffel and Simsbert discuss the Jedi Order. What are these mystical warriors all about? What is the Force? Why is Qui-Gon Jinn rigging chance cubes so that he can steal a child and casually take his blood?&#13;
&#13;
Their ongoing investigation reveals new insights into many aspects of these robed street people, including: explaining the ridiculousness of midichlorians, the poorly designed “revolving-restaurant” headquarters, and why love is forbidden for all Jedi.&#13;

  <description>Queen elect, high school dropout, hand maiden?&#13;
&#13;
This week Griffin and David look at Queen Amidala and the history of the royalty of Naboo. Why was actress Natalie Portman widely trashed for her performance in this movie? With the complicated costumes, the extravagant hair, the memorable make up, was it the strange choice to speak like a Canadian from South Park? Was Keira Knightley acting as Queen Amidala’s double supposed to be a surprise? These questions and more are answered in our next installment.&#13;
&#13;
Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the separately sold hyperdrive repair kit and the boys restate their hypothesis: Was if this movie is about Trade Regulations?</description>

  <description>The year was 1999. It had been twenty-two years since George Lucas last directed a feature film. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was highly anticipated. But then why did the majority of audiences and critics hate it so much?&#13;
&#13;
Sixteen years later, Griffin and David started this podcast with one question in mind: &quot;what is The Phantom Menace REALLY about?&quot; Here in their debut episode, the hosts set out to do just that by beginning their investigation with the first eight minutes of the movie. Join them as we meet Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn and protegé Obi-Wan Kenobi, the very sexual TC-14, learn about the trade federation and get some insight into how a fourteen year old girl could be elected queen of a planet. Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the CommTech Communicator that made action figures talk.</description>
