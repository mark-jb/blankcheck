      <title>28 Years Later</title>
      <description>Blank Check is going back to the British Isles with Danny Boyle, Alex Garland, and one extraordinarily well-endowed zombie this week as they discuss 28 Years Later. This movie has so much to love in it – wet bones, third-act Ralph Fiennes, Jodie Comer doing a thing, the Angel of the North, Teletubbies, the aforementioned well-endowed zombies, mind-bending digital photography, and did we mention THE WET BONES??? Be prepared for David to get REAL British, for Marie to cry on mic, for Griffin to bring up the manosphere, and for Ben to learn about Operation Yewtree. Gosh, we love this movie so much.

      <title>Loser with Chandler Levack</title>
      <description>The song. The hat. The…casual date rape?!!? In what should have been Amy Heckerling’s “blank check” after the success of Clueless, 2000’s Loser is a real LOSER. Filmmaker Chandler Levack joins us to chat about this technically-not-a-remake-of-The-Apartment “comedy” that gets college surprisingly wrong. Come for the Wheatus talk, stay for the in-depth power ranking of every American Pie cast member’s post-Pie career.

      <title>Clueless with Heidi Gardner</title>
      <description>Okay, so you’re probably going, “Is this like a Noxzema commercial or what?” But seriously, this is actually a way normal podcast about one of David Sims’ favorite movies! SNL’s Heidi Gardner (a total betty) joins us to talk about Amy Heckerling’s beloved Jane Austen adaptation, and we’re rolling with the homies. Join us for Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd career discussion, a lot of local Kansas City lore, and Ben’s takes on Cher’s iconic fits.

      <title>Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning</title>
      <description>Griffin, David, Ben, and Marie accepted the mission. They live and pod in the shadows, for those they hold close, and for those they never meet. They also have a few notes for Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie with regards to Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning. Join the crew as they break down all the problems of this latest (and final???) installment of the beloved franchise. Join them as they rave over some of the most incredible sequences ever to grace the silver screen - ALSO in this movie. It’s a mixed bag, folks. But speaking of bags - we still love popcorn. And movies.

If you’re in NY check out the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE—Story and Spectacle at the Museum of the Moving Image

      <title>Look Who's Talking Too with Max Minghella</title>
      <description>The Ubriacco family are back and - can you believe it? - they’re still talking! Actor and filmmaker Max Minghella joins us to talk about Look Who’s Talking Too, the contractually-obligated, quickly produced sequel to Amy Heckerling’s surprise hit. We’re talking about Mr. Toilet Man (he eats your pee pee and poo poo), Elias Koteas’ Mr. Scary Uncle Man (he has a gun), and Mr. English Man (David Sims, who grew up in London). Plus, Ben continues to flesh out his “Look Who Hath Talked” prequel, and Griffin becomes the first person with the courage to ask, “Who was the first baby?”

      <title>Look Who's Talking with Hillary Busis</title>
      <description>In perhaps the spermiest film we’ve ever covered, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley hang out with a baby voiced by Bruce Willis and Amy Heckerling gets revenge on Harold Ramis. As David Sims says early in this episode - Look Who’s Talking is a VERY RICH text. Vanity Fair’s Hillary Busis joins us to talk about this 1989 “forgotbuster,” a film that made a bozo amount of money and dared to ask the question, “What if baby talked??” We’re going deep on Travolta lore, grappling with Kirstie Alley’s later career, and following numerous tangents on everything from the rules of the Rugrats universe to advancements in crib safety. Look who’s podcasting!

      <title>Johnny Dangerously with Josh Gondelman</title>
      <description>He’s the nicest bad guy in town. His last name is an adverb. And he’s got some pretty wacky bits! Sweetie pie comedian Josh Gondelman joins us to talk about 1984’s Johnny Dangerously, Amy Heckerling’s loving homage to 1930’s gangster pictures. Things we attempt to understand in this episode: the cultural legacy of Joe Piscopo; the actual joke that’s being told in the “Your Testicles and You” animated reel / is there one?; Marilu Henner’s insane memory thing; if the Danny DeVito bull scene is a parody of anything; why does Richie Rich have cent signs in his name if he’s so rich?; and most crucially - why is this movie so damned hard to see in 2025?!?! Real fans know that Blank Check started off as an investigative podcast. Maybe it’s time to bring that element back!

      <title>Fast Times at Ridgemont High with Lola Kirke</title>
      <description>We’re grabbing our Vans slip ons and heading to the mall as we kick off our Amy Heckerling series - Pod Times at Ridgemont Cast - with Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Fresh off her appearance in Sinners, actual high school friend of Griffin Newman Lola Kirke returns to the pod and things get pretty bogus. Like, David Lynch was supposed to direct this movie!!! David Sims has three performances from this on his 1982 Oscar Ballot! We develop sympathy for Mr. Hand! Griffin used to own a pair of fully black Converse sneakers! And, of course - Ben orders a pizza.



Listen to An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba

      <title>Schindler's List with David Ehrlich</title>
      <description>Our Early Spielberg series concludes with a movie that is a super fun time and not at all distressing to watch in our current political climate! David Ehrlich joins us to discuss 1993’s Schindler’s List, the film that defined the visual language of the Holocaust and finally got Spielberg his Oscar. We’re getting into the critical debates about this film’s “watchability,” the fact that this was only Ralph Fiennes’ second screen performance, and our (likely controversial) definitive ranking of Spielberg’s full filmography.

      <title>Jurassic Park with Sean Fennessey</title>
      <description>God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Steven Spielberg. Steven Spielberg makes 1993’s Jurassic Park and changes movie history. The Big Picture’s Sean Fennessey joins us to talk about this totemic blockbuster, and we’re spending three hours talking about the bad boys of the Jurassic era (velociraptors), the bad boys of ILM (Steve ‘Spaz’ Williams and Mark Dippe), and the bad boy of movie scientists (Dr. Ian Malcolm).

Note: this episode was recorded last fall, so some of the takes you’ll hear are a bit…frozen in amber. Yup, you guessed it. Hawk Tuah Talk again.

      <title>Hook with Lin-Manuel Miranda</title>
      <description>Everyone knows Captain Hook got swallowed by the crocodile at the end of Peter Pan. But what this movie presupposes is…maybe he didn’t? Let us go back to a time when the coolest thing a kid could have was a clubhouse that looked like a skatepark…when the worst thing a dad could do was own a cell phone…and when the craziest thing a filmmaker could do was agree to make a movie that started off as a child’s drawing. Lin-Manuel Miranda - most famous for starring as Captain Hook in his sixth grade production of Peter Pan - joins us on a trip to Neverland as we unpack Spielberg’s 1991 fantasia Hook. Bangarang, Blankies! And RIP Rufio.

      <title>Always with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>Is it possible for Steven Spielberg to make a movie that doesn’t exist? Well, he sure tried with 1989’s Always, a film where John Goodman plays Monterey Jack of the Rescue Rangers, Richard Dreyfuss riffs to no one as an annoying ghost, and Holly Hunter falls in love with the most dull hottie at the Plane Depot. Our beloved Richard Lawson joins us to talk planes, boy bands, Marlboro merch, and the enduring mystery of what happened between Kathy Bates, Holly Hunter, and Fran McD in that famous apartment.

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with Chris Gethard</title>
      <description>What if Indiana Jones had a dad who was a “grail scholar" but also his “eskimo brother" and he was played by James Bond and he had a funny little hat? We are so glad Steven Spielberg dared to imagine this scenario because we got Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade out of it! Chris Gethard - The self-proclaimed “Bad Boy of Blank Check Guests” - joins the crew to talk about this delightful film, considered a fulcrum point in Spielberg’s career where he switches perspectives from son to father. We’re talking about daddy issues. We’re asking if Kazim is the Kit Fisto of this film. We’re wondering if Elsa looking hottest when dressed as a Nazi is a weird psychosexual thing Spielberg is exploring. We’re realizing in real time that Indiana Jones might be a terrible archeologist. Basically - you should hand in your blimp tickets and join us on a very fun ride.

      <itunes:summary>What if Indiana Jones had a dad who was a “grail scholar" but also his “eskimo brother" and he was played by James Bond and he had a funny little hat? We are so glad Steven Spielberg dared to imagine this scenario because we got Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade out of it! Chris Gethard - The self-proclaimed “Bad Boy of Blank Check Guests” - joins the crew to talk about this delightful film, considered a fulcrum point in Spielberg’s career where he switches perspectives from son to father. We’re talking about daddy issues. We’re asking if Kazim is the Kit Fisto of this film. We’re wondering if Elsa looking hottest when dressed as a Nazi is a weird psychosexual thing Spielberg is exploring. We’re realizing in real time that Indiana Jones might be a terrible archeologist. Basically - you should hand in your blimp tickets and join us on a very fun ride.

      <title>Empire of the Sun with Bilge Ebiri</title>
      <description>Our Spielbergian journey takes us to new dramatic heights with 1987’s Empire of the Sun, the film that brought us Christian Bale (discovered by Amy Irving!), unexpected Joey Pants and Ben Stiller appearances, and a perfect use of John Malkovich. Bilge Ebiri joins us (and the Five Timers Club) to chat about how underrated this film is within the Spielberg canon, and how this movie evolves Spielberg’s perception as a serious dramatic artist.

      <title>The Color Purple with Kenice Mobley</title>
      <description>After inventing the Hollywood blockbuster with Jaws, creating the world’s most loveable alien with E.T., and resurrecting the classic adventure serial with the Indiana Jones franchise, of course the next logical step in Steven Spielberg’s career was to…adapt Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize winning novel about the survival and strength of queer black women in the American south? Duh! Obviously! Comedian Kenice Mobley joins us to talk about 1985’s truly baffling and seismically important The Color Purple in our latest episode. We want to thank Quincy Jones for discovering Oprah and producing this movie. We want to yell at Quincy Jones for his awful, treacly score.

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom with Olivia Craighead</title>
      <description>“Doom” isn’t just describing a Temple here, folks - it’s kind of the overarching vibe of this film! George Lucas is going through a bitter divorce. Steven Spielberg is dealing with PTSD from Twilight Zone: The Movie. Harrison Ford is suffering from a back injury from falling off an elephant or something. Kate Capshaw is there. A true cloud of doom hanging over this movie! Fortunately for you all, it’s only great vibes for us and Olivia Craighead *podcasting* about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It’s the return of the “George Lucas got cucked by the stained glass man” lore, of course we’re gonna have a blast.

      <title>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</title>
      <description>We’re putting out a bit of a throwback episode for the most iconic (literal) blankie in film history - this week’s E.T. episode is guestless, with Griffin going rogue off the dossier, David making fun of Griffin for being an adult who likes toys and animation, and Ben getting emotional over a family film…decade of dreams, baby! Join us as we gush over the child performances, creature creation, and authentic emotionality of Spielberg’s canonical hit. Did you know that the Italian guy who designed E.T. kind of looks like E.T.? Or that Researcher JJ wrote his doctoral dissertation about the Reese’s Pieces product placement in this movie? Open the schools! But please - no frog dissections.

      <description>You’re a young movie fan. It’s 1981. STEVEN SPIELBERG is teaming up with FREAKING GEORGE LUCAS (!?!?!) to make a movie with HAN SOLO…can you imagine how hyped you’d be?? Marvel Comics legend Brian Michael Bendis joins us to recount the colossal impact of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK in this rollicking adventure of an episode. Jewish mysticism and weird Nazi stuff! Alfred Molina getting covered with a bunch of live spiders! Karen Allen coming up with an incredibly detailed backstory for Marion and Spielberg being like, “sure, whatever”! Danny DeVito almost being cast as Saleh?!?! You bet we’re getting into it, snakes and all.

      <title>1941 with Mike Mitchell &amp; Nick Wiger</title>
      <description>He invented the summer blockbuster. He inspired millions of people around the world to “watch the skies.” And now, he has sent Griffin Newman into an existential crisis over the question “what is comedy?” Our friends Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger of The Doughboys join us to talk about Steven Spielberg’s infamously unfunny 1941. Why IS this film - loaded with so many comedic superstars - boring as shit? Is the opening scene one of the most embarrassing exercises in hubris ever committed to screen? Would this movie be better if they just inserted the entirety of Dumbo into it? Why does Eddie Deezen keep getting banned from dining establishments? Someone has to ask these things.

      <title>Close Encounters of the Third Kind with J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>Five curious tones. A mountain of mashed potatoes. Bob Balaban with a beard speaking french. After the industry-changing success of JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND feels like a classic “blank check.” But it’s a little more nuanced than that! JD Amato returns for his 10th mainfeed appearance this week, and we’re getting into all of the production drama, real nerdy practical effects shit (cloud boxing!), and the complicated feelings we have towards the behavior of the adults in this movie. Seems like young Stevie Spielberg has some divorce trauma he’s working through! Has anyone ever made that observation before?

      <title>Jaws with Timothy Simons</title>
      <description>Dunnnh dun. Dunnnh dun. Never before had two notes provoked such terror as they did in JAWS, the 1975 classic that invented the summer blockbuster, catapulted Steven Spielberg to Hollywood legend status, and inspired generational trauma about water. Actor and recognizable famous person Timothy Simons joins us to talk about this classic shark tale, and we go long on Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw, and the career of journeyman director Joseph Sargent (?). Which member of the Blank Check crew would be least likely to get attacked by a shark? Obviously Ben, because he respects water. What the hell did Chief Brody think he was gonna do when he apprehended the shark - arrest it? Why isn’t Griffin familiar with the concept of a ferry? We dare to ask these questions, just as the citizens of Amity dared to go into the water.

      <itunes:summary>Dunnnh dun. Dunnnh dun. Never before had two notes provoked such terror as they did in JAWS, the 1975 classic that invented the summer blockbuster, catapulted Steven Spielberg to Hollywood legend status, and inspired generational trauma about water. Actor and recognizable famous person Timothy Simons joins us to talk about this classic shark tale, and we go long on Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw, and the career of journeyman director Joseph Sargent (?). Which member of the Blank Check crew would be least likely to get attacked by a shark? Obviously Ben, because he respects water. What the hell did Chief Brody think he was gonna do when he apprehended the shark - arrest it? Why isn’t Griffin familiar with the concept of a ferry? We dare to ask these questions, just as the citizens of Amity dared to go into the water.

      <title>The Sugarland Express with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <description>Young whippersnapper Steven Spielberg continues his run of dusty, road-centric films with 1974’s THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, and we’re along for the (surprisingly chill) ride. Writer Esther Zuckerman joins us to discuss the cinematic persona of Goldie Hawn, William Atherton’s strange period of leading-man roles, the harmonica stylings of Belgian jazz legend Toots Thielemans, and Spielberg’s brief but fruitful collaboration with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. Note - we recorded this episode a few months in advance. We no longer endorse the whole Hawk Tuah thing.

      <title>Duel</title>
      <description>2025! Blank Check Year 10! Year of Miracles! In honor of our record 10th year of podcasting, we’re doing something we’ve never done before - going back to fill in the gaps on a filmography we’ve previously only partially covered. And what a filmography it is - folks, welcome to PODRASSIC CAST. We’re starting our exploration of the first half of Steven Spielberg’s career with his remarkable 1971 debut feature DUEL, a movie that was originally made for TV but later released with extra footage for a theatrical run. Driving is scary. Being this talented right off the bat is ALSO scary but in a different way. Beep beep, honk honk.

      <title>Twin Peaks: The Return (Episodes 14-18) with Jane Schoenbrun</title>
      <description>What year is it? Well, it’s 2024 - but not for long. It’s our last episode of the year! Director of this year’s I SAW THE TV GLOW Jane Schoenbrun joins us to talk about the conclusion of Twin Peaks: The Return, and, by default, the conclusion of our David Lynch series. In a show that intentionally defies the very concept of resolution, how do we put a bow on things? Well, we try! Shout out to Freddie and his glove. Oh, and Merry Christmas. Trauma is originary and unending.

      <title>Twin Peaks: The Return (Episodes 9-13) with Fran Hoepfner</title>
      <description>Dougie gets it on (or, more accurately, Naomi Watts gets HER Dougie on), guest Fran Hoepfner pitches her artisanal slime for adults (don’t steal the idea), and we relitigate LOST for the hundredth time in this penultimate episode of our Twin Peaks: The Return coverage. Can adults get mono? Why is it so hard for Lucy and Andy to buy a chair? THAT is the Audrey Horne plot? Will someone please have sympathy for David Sims, who isn’t going gray yet and desperately wants a cool subway-themed videogame?

      <title>Twin Peaks: The Return (Episode 8) with Connor Ratliff</title>
      <description>This is the podcast. These are the (two) friends. Drink full, and descend. The famous “Atomic Bomb” episode of The Return stands as one of David Lynch’s most defining works, an “origin story” for Twin Peaks, and one of the most experimental hours ever to air on narrative television. In a rare moment of “double dipping,” Twin Peaks S2 guest Connor Ratliff joins us again to discuss this landmark episode, offering a David Lynch impression that is superior to Griffin’s, which you probably thought could not be topped. We’re offering theories and explanations this episode, but we’re also talking about when Charlie died on Two and a Half Men and how to dodge LIRR fares because, of course. Gotta light?

      <title>Twin Peaks: The Return (Episodes 1-7)</title>
      <description>It is happening again - we’re covering TV! Or is it an 18-part movie? Much to ponder. We’re heading back to the Pacific Northwest (and Vegas…and New York…and the Red Room…and outer space?) in our first of four episodes covering Showtime’s 2017 series “Twin Peaks: The Return.” So far, we’ve got tulpas, Caleb Laundry Bag, three distinct versions of Dale Cooper, Dr. Jacobi’s gold shovels, Michael Cera doing a bad Marlon Brando impression, creamed corn barf, Matthew Lillard, a cryptic final message from the Log Lady, and a whole slew of David Lynch’s favorite contemporary indie bands. Suffice it to say - we’re hooked!

      <title>Inland Empire with David Rees</title>
      <description>Only on Blank Check would an episode about David Lynch’s deeply destabilizing INLAND EMPIRE turn into a heartfelt celebration of creativity and the human experience. David Rees joins us and brings receipts - including literal receipts for every movie ticket he purchased in 2007 and his high school newspaper review of Twin Peaks (a pan) - as we gush about David Lynch’s singular position in American culture. Plus, we delve into tons of Laura Dern context, discuss dreams where you inhabit a different person, and spend an inordinate amount of time talking about the Snuffy Smith comic strip.

      <title>Mulholland Drive with Leslye Headland</title>
      <description>Is it a dream? Is it about a dream? Is it a TV pilot? Is it the greatest film of the 21st century? In any case, Leslye Headland returns to the podcast to talk about David Lynch’s endlessly fascinating 2001 masterpiece MULHOLLAND DR. We may not have all the answers, but we do have a lot of thoughts about Hollywood, about Billy Ray Cyrus, about actors being shoved down audiences’ throats, about diners, about Patrick Fischler’s eyebrows, about the diner owned by Patrick Fischler’s dad, about Naomi Watts’ friendship with Nicole Kidman, about Corky Romano…the list goes on.

We may not have all the answers, but we do have a lot of thoughts about Hollywood, about Billy Ray Cyrus, about actors being shoved down audiences’ throats, about diners, about Patrick Fischler’s eyebrows, about the diner owned by Patrick Fischler’s dad, about Naomi Watts’ friendship with Nicole Kidman, about Corky Romano…the list goes on.</p><p><br></p><p>If you're in NYC starting November 20th, 2024, check out Leslye's new play Cult of Love </p><p><a href="https://2st.com/shows/cult-of-love">Get Tickets Now </a></p><p><br></p><p>The Box Office Game is Sponsored by Regal Cinemas:</p><p><a href="http://blankcheckpod.com/regal">Sign up for Regal Unlimited today</a> and get 10% off your 3 month subscription when using code BLANKCHECK</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://blankcheckpod.substack.com/welcome">Sign up for Check Book</a>, the Blank Check newsletter featuring even more “real nerdy shit” to feed your pop culture obsession.

      <title>Here</title>
      <description>We apologize in advance if you had a profound emotional experience with the new Robert Zemeckis joint - HERE felt like more of a “Here?? What???? Why?” to us. Dinosaurs, Benjamin Franklin’s cuck son, a man dying from laughter, a horny couple who invent the LA-Z Boy, airplane man (who does NOT die from airplane), and the double whammy of the Black Lives Matter movement and Covid all come together to create a strange boomer diorama that misses much of the quotidian beauty of Richard McGuire’s graphic novel. Will Bobby Z. ever make a good movie again? Griffin’s not feeling bullish on the prospects.

      <title>The Straight Story with Dana Stevens</title>
      <description>Walt Disney Pictures Presents A Film By David Lynch. And what a beautiful, expectation-defying, G-rated, cold-glass-of-beer film it is. Dana Stevens joins us to talk about 1999’s The Straight Story, a film that showcases Lynch’s fascination with Americana and his deep empathy for characters on the margins. Join us on a journey through the Midwest (Griffin can’t drive, but he’s a great passenger), where we talk about braunschweiger, cheese castles, bundles of sticks, Chicago theater actors without photos on their IMDB pages, and the fascinating career of actor Richard Farnsworth. Dude was in Gone With the Wind!

      <title>Lost Highway with David Lowery</title>
      <description>1997’s Lost Highway - is it (as David Sims wrote on Letterboxd), “a movie about headache”? Is it David Lynch’s most visually beautiful film? Is it a dry run for Mulholland Dr? A radical reimagining of Bill Pullman’s screen presence? A psychogenic fugue? Lynch’s commentary on the OJ Simpson trial? An excuse for David Sims to go off on the concept of “free jazz”?? Folks - we are pleased to tell you that it is all of the above and more. The great David Lowery joins us to talk about Lynch’s deeply haunted neo-noir nightmare - a film that dares to ask the question, “What if you woke up one morning as Balthazar Getty?”

      <title>Joker: Hallie À Goodrich</title>
      <description>What if they made a sequel to the Joker movie that was pretty much the finale of Seinfeld but it’s also a half-assed jukebox musical, and EVERYONE hated it? What if Michael Keaton had a 35-year-old pregnant daughter, but he also had precocious 9-year-old twins and a Los Angeles art gallery on the verge of financial collapse? Both scenarios lay the groundwork for two of the most “they don’t make ‘em like this” films of the year, and BOTH conclude with the same Daniel Johnston song. You can’t make this stuff up, folks! Join the crew for a fever dream of an episode that features an all-timer of a Madame Web tangent, Griffin’s grand theory of Todd Phillips self-sabotage, and some earnest reflections on the past 499 episodes that have led us to this monumental achievement.

      <title>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me with Arkasha Stevenson</title>
      <description>One of the more harrowing films we’ve covered on the podcast (and the second film we’ve covered in 2024 with a memorable “gobble gobble” line), 1992’s TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME was not the quirky, enjoyable plotline wrap-up fans of Twin Peaks wanted. David Lynch instead challenged the audience to identify with Laura Palmer’s humanity and pain, making her a real person - not just a girl wrapped in plastic. THE FIRST OMEN director Arkasha Stevenson joins us to talk about how this film (and WILD AT HEART) inspired her to become a filmmaker, the uncanny experience of watching it without any prior knowledge of the Twin Peaks series, and the directorial choices Lynch makes that create the film’s deeply unsettling atmosphere.

      <title>Wild at Heart with Tatiana Maslany</title>
      <description>If we told you this was the first time we’d covered a Nicolas Cage movie on the podcast - would you believe us? Well, baby - it’s true. And what a movie it is! The luminous Tatiana Maslany returns to talk about David Lynch’s smokin’ hot outlaw romance WILD AT HEART - a film that won the Palme d’Or and took Lynch away from the set of Twin Peaks. Get ready for lots of Cage career discussion (a favorite topic of Griffin Newman), a bunch of actor speak, and multiple “hey, did you know David Lynch was a fan of the Wizard of Oz?” asides.

      <title>Twin Peaks (Season 1) with Eva Anderson</title>
      <description>For a brief shining moment, Middle America went crazy for the surreal soap opera stylings of David Lynch and Mark Frost. We’re talking ABC, primetime, airing against “Cheers”-level mainstream. And then it all came crashing down. Listen as we take our first step into the intoxicating world of Twin Peaks - one of the most influential television series of all time and the project that would come to define Lynch for the rest of his career. Eva Anderson - who literally grew up in the town Twin Peaks was filmed in and can tell you for a fact that the diner cherry pie sucks - joins us to talk about how such a pop cultural oddity came to be, and why it has such staying power. Note - this episode covers Season 1 of Twin Peaks, but alludes to certain plotlines in Season 2 without directly spoiling them. 

Blank Check Theme (Cherry Pie Remix) composed by Alex Mitchell, vocals by "The ghost of Julee Cruise" aka Marie Bardi.

      <title>Blue Velvet with Jamie Loftus</title>
      <description>Lend us your (severed) ears! This week, we’re jumping back into our Lynch series with a trip to Lumberton, USA, as our beloved Jamie Loftus joins us to chat about 1986’s BLUE VELVET. We’re going deep on the star persona of Kyle MacLachlan, David Sims’ obsession with Dean Stockwell, and David Lynch’s unironic obsession with Americana. How does a movie that deals with such deeply disturbing themes end up being so watchable? That’s that Lynchian magic, baby!

      <description>We’re taking a break from David Lynch to answer one of the year’s biggest questions - Is Burton Back, Baby? Ummmm…kind of! Grab your “Handbook for the Recently Deceased” commemorative popcorn tin and join us as we attempt to untangle the very messy BEETLEJUICE BEETLEJUICE. Which sequences wowed us with their sparkling ingenuity? Which plotlines would we excise from the script? What song would you possess people to lipsync to and why is it Bloodhound Gang’s “The Bad Touch”? And - the most important question of all - why has David Sims not been publishing movie reviews lately, why wasn’t he at TIFF, and what the hell is going on at the Sims Swamp?

      <title>Dune with John Hodgman</title>
      <description>The sleeper must awaken. The filmography must contain a flop. We’ve arrived at the Planet Arrakis aka the Desert Planet aka DUNE (1984) - David Lynch’s attempt at wrangling Frank Herbert’s space epic into a single studio blockbuster. Did it work? Not really. Do we have fun talking about it? Hell yeah, we do! John Hodgman joins us to talk about all things “spice” - including the infamous glossary of Dune terms handed out in theaters, and a wild anecdote about Peter Berg reading Dune on an airplane. We talk about Lynch’s decision to turn down directing Return of the Jedi, the differences between Lynch’s take on Dune and Denis Villeneuve’s more critically successful version, and David finally gets the chance to let his Fremen freak flag fly by going FULL NERD.

      <itunes:summary>The sleeper must awaken. The filmography must contain a flop. We’ve arrived at the Planet Arrakis aka the Desert Planet aka DUNE (1984) - David Lynch’s attempt at wrangling Frank Herbert’s space epic into a single studio blockbuster. Did it work? Not really. Do we have fun talking about it? Hell yeah, we do! John Hodgman joins us to talk about all things “spice” - including the infamous glossary of Dune terms handed out in theaters, and a wild anecdote about Peter Berg reading Dune on an airplane. We talk about Lynch’s decision to turn down directing Return of the Jedi, the differences between Lynch’s take on Dune and Denis Villeneuve’s more critically successful version, and David finally gets the chance to let his Fremen freak flag fly by going FULL NERD.

      <title>The Elephant Man with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>We’re getting in touch with our emotions this week, as Alex Ross Perry joins us to talk about Lynch’s deeply-felt, sensitively-rendered 1980 classic THE ELEPHANT MAN. Is this the most “normal” movie in Lynch’s filmography? What does “normal” mean, anyway? As with all Alex episodes, questions are posed and hotly debated, such as: What filmmakers, aside from David Lynch, made their most important work in the later part of their careers? What is the Lynch film that young people vibe with most strongly now? Did Michael Jackson actually attempt to purchase the Elephant Man’s bones? When will the Cinematrix puzzle get rid of the godforsaken “Rotten Tomatoes score” category? What does David Sims have against the famous David Foster Wallace profile of David Lynch?

      <title>Eraserhead</title>
      <description>In heaven (and in podcasting), everything is fine. Welcome to TWIN PODS: FIRE CAST WITH ME, a series on the films of David Lynch - former Eagle Scout and totally normal human man. With his 1977 debut feature ERASERHEAD, Lynch burst on to the scene somewhat fully formed as an artist, confused by normal social interactions and motivated by a seething hatred of Philadelphia. The last part of that sentence is only partially a joke. Join us as we discuss where Eraserhead fits in the pantheon of first features we’ve covered on Blank Check, where this film ranks in the “Dang Ass Freak” canon, whether we first watched this movie in a basement or on a “night porch,” the stress of parenthood, the origin story of McDonald’s mascot Grimace, and much more. Oh, and obviously - the Lady in the Radiator makes an appearance. You are not hallucinating, she is really there.

      <title>Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1</title>
      <description>Welp, our Kevin Costner series ends not with a bang, but a whimper. With the pulling of Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2 from theaters, we are left to only speculate what the future holds for Costner’s self-funded crazy passion project. What we can tell you is that Chapter 1 doesn’t really feel like its own self-contained movie. Plotlines are established, characters are introduced, and then…Giovanni Ribisi shows up.

      <title>Trap</title>
      <description>You know the Butcher? That freakin' nutjob that goes around just chopping people up? Well, we’re about to spend nearly three hours talking about him! Join us as we unpack TRAP - the devilishly entertaining new thriller from M. Night Shyamalan, with special insights from our own David Sims, who spent much of this year interviewing Night at his compound in Philadelphia. We’re talking about a bunch of things - dads, serial killers, how much we don’t like going to concerts, the sexy elephant mascot of the New York Liberty, Josh Hartnett’s career arc - when we’re not excusing ourselves to go to the bathroom to uh…check on some apps.

      <title>Open Range with Chris Ryan</title>
      <description>Free-grazers and CR-heads - this is your week. The icon, the legend, the Ringer’s own Chris Ryan joins us to talk about Kevin Costner’s understated 2003 western OPEN RANGE. We’re finally doing a deep-dive on the Taylor Sheridan empire (aka Chris tells us what Mayor of Kingstown is actually about) as we set up the later part of Costner’s career in the run-up to Horizon. We spend a good amount of time lauding the consistent greatness of Robert Duvall and Annette Bening. You can practically hear the relief in our voices when we talk about how this movie is actually quite good! It may or may not be racist against the Irish, but - hey. How great is that chocolate scene?!

      <title>The Postman with Emily St. James</title>
      <description>This week’s movie has everything - fake teeth on Giovanni Ribisi, a mule performing Shakespeare, Tom Petty, Kevin Costner’s irresistible sperm…you read that correctly. This film has a major plot line that revolves around Kevin Costner’s sperm. Our beloved Emily St. James joins us to talk about Kevin Costner’s colossal 1997 flop, the post-apocalyptic ode to the US Postal Service - THE POSTMAN. There are parts of this movie that are truly moving. There are other parts of this movie where Kevin Costner and Will Patton wrestle in slow motion. It’s a fascinating text. 

Buy Emily’s Book about Lost: LOST: Back to the Island: The Complete Critical Companion to The Classic TV Series

Be on the lookout for Emily’s Novel “Woodworking” out April 2025 - Read more HERE

      <title>Dances with Wolves</title>
      <description>In a first for Blank Check, we’re covering a filmmaker who has acted alongside our own Griffin Newman! In our premiere episode covering the directorial career of Draft Day co-star Kevin Costner, we’re unpacking his 1990 Best Picture winner, DANCES WITH WOLVES. Costner as personal mythmaker, Costner as “movie sports guy,” Costner as “hot guy who women all want to sleep with (?)”, Costner as man who decided - at a crucial (and early!) point in his career - to take a huge risk by making a 3-hour epic in an old-fashioned genre. He’s a fascinating figure. Come west with us, listeners, as we discover the frontiers within ourselves and within Lieutenant John Dunbar.

      <title>Gigli with Jen D'Angelo</title>
      <description>The first "G" in "Gigli" is pronounced like the "J" in “Jacques,” the second “G” is silent. Rhymes with "really." Now that that’s out of the way - we conclude our Martin Brest series with the turkey of all turkeys. The Bennifer original sin, the project that should have gotten Justin Bartha put in prison. That’s right, folks. We’re talking about one of the canonical “Worst Movies Ever Made” - 2003’s GIGLI. Screenwriter Jen D’Angelo joins us to talk about this fascinating cultural object, and makes a case that Ben Affleck is “good in this movie, actually.” Griffin and David disagree. We’re going to Baywatch!

      <title>Meet Joe Black with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>He’s hot. He’s got frosted tips. He loves peanut butter. His lil swimmers may or may not look like skulls. He’s death, baby! And we’re meeting him this week! Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson returns to the pod to chat about 1998’s three hour long “symphonic metaphysical romance” MEET JOE BLACK. How does this film play in a post-Succession, “eat the rich” context? How do we feel about the infamous Jamaican patois scenes? What are our memories of the weekend the Phantom Menace trailer came out in theaters? All that and more awaits you on the other side of the bridge.

      <description>Warning - this episode contains an ungodly amount of Pacino impressions. Listener discretion is advised.
“Actor’s actor” and local boy from Queens David Krumholtz becomes the second cast member of Oppenheimer and first person immortalized in Griffin’s beloved Disney Emoji Blitz to guest on our Martin Brest series as we talk about 1992’s dire SCENT OF A WOMAN. Would this movie be less terrible if it were at least 40 minutes shorter? What if the original first choice for Lt. Col. Frank Slade - Jack Nicholson - had done this film instead of Pacino? What if we swapped Philip Seymour Hoffman for the charisma vacuum that is Chris O’Donnell? Sadly, we can only imagine these scenarios. Join us for lots of candid Krumholtz anecdotes, a scorching hot take regarding the diner scene in Heat, and more!

      <title>Midnight Run with Alan Sepinwall</title>
      <description>In a first for Blank Check, Ben Hosley produces an entire episode while handcuffed and under threat of legal action. What else would you expect from a MIDNIGHT RUN episode? The great Alan Sepinwall returns to the pod to talk about Martin Brest’s fantastic cross-country buddy caper, a film that proved that DeNiro could do comedy and that Charles Grodin might be the funniest man alive. We’re talking about the unofficial Larry the Cable Guy sequel (?), the famous casting what-ifs (Cher!), and the magic that went into making this movie so breezy, effortless, and fun. We didn’t how good we had it back in 1988, did we?l

      <title>Beverly Hills Cop with Adil &amp; Bilall</title>
      <description>An indelible synth theme by Harold Faltermeyer. A scene-stealing turn from Bronson Pinchot. A banana in a tailpipe. EDDIE FREAKING MURPHY. It’s no wonder that Martin Brest’s Beverly Hills Cop is one of the most beloved action comedies (and still the highest-grossing R-rated film adjusted for inflation). We couldn’t be more thrilled to have two of the hottest action directors in Hollywood - Bad Boys: Ride or Die’s Adil &amp; Bilall - join us to talk about Brest’s blockbuster second feature, bringing all the expertise from their years spent developing Beverly Hills Cop 4. We’re getting into the Stallone of it all, the Simpson/Bruckheimer of it all, the Judge Reinhold of it all - while also taking some time to unpack the specific nuances that Brest brings as a director (as opposed to Tony Scott’s take on the sequel). And….yes. We talk about BATGIRL.

      <title>Furiosa with Kyle Buchanan</title>
      <description>We return to the Wasteland this week with Furiosa, and we’ve got quite the tour guide. Kyle Buchanan - author of Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome, THE book on the making of Mad Max: Fury Road - joins us as we do a definitive post-mortem on George Miller’s latest. Going up against the reputation of Fury Road was always going to be an uphill battle for the Anya Taylor-Joy starrer, and we go into all the ways in which this film matches, exceeds, or misses the highs of 2015’s action classic. Kyle brings with him plenty of behind-the-scenes details and shrewd observations, and Ben and Griffin bring a visceral report from their 4DX screening. And yes - of course we talk about how Dementus looks just like Guru Pitka.

      <title>Paprika with Emily Yoshida</title>
      <description>Come join the dream parade, folks - we’re talking about Paprika! Mother of the Blankies Emily Yoshida is with us to chat about Satoshi Kon’s final film - a film that FEELS like a swan song especially in hindsight. In this episode, we address the elephant in the room (those Inception comparisons), dive into the serialized story Paprika was based on, and Griffin makes the important connection between Paprika’s “DC mini” device and this being a “BC mini” (series). Plus, we establish 2024 as “The Year of Dreams” (Kon and Lynch on Blank Check!!), and Emily, Ben, and Griffin discuss their experience attending a special screening of Clifford with Martin Short himself.  
Check out Shogun on FX and listen to Shogun: The Official Podcast hosted by Emily  
Read Emily’s writing on Paprika 
Please follow Hollywood Entertainment (the organizers of the Clifford screening mentioned on the episode)for upcoming screenings in LA (including a new residency at Heavy Manners Library), regular streaming programs (accessible everywhere), and a to-be-announced return to New York this fall.

      <title> Tokyo Godfathers with Reece Feldman</title>
      <description>They call them the Godfathers of Tokyo…and we call him the KING of TIKTOK (in an old man newscaster voice) - Reece Feldman joins us to chat about Satoshi Kon’s beautiful Christmas fable about a trio of unforgettable characters on the fringes of society. We talk about how animation is truly a medium and NOT a genre, as evidenced by this film. We talk about Ice Age (another animated movie where outsiders care for a baby). We talk about whether or not David might get roped into watching Ice Age a million times if his daughter finds out about it. And we talk about David’s pitch for a Cheaper by the Dozen spoof called “Cheaper by the Cousin”…?

      <title>Millennium Actress with Hoai-Tran Bui</title>
      <description>Our Satoshi Kon series continues with his 2003 film Millennium Actress, a moving exploration of memory, history, and the magic of da moviesh. Writer Hoai-Tran Bui returns to the pod as we discuss the strange history of Dreamworks’ arthouse animation arm (Go Fish pictures), the luminous screen presence of Setsuko Hara, and the added poignancy this film takes on in light of Kon’s untimely passing. Plus, Griffin publicly addresses the Penny Marshall debacle, and the gang contemplates a version of “Millennium Actor” with Clint Eastwood.

      <title>Perfect Blue with Bowen Yang</title>
      <description>Welcome to the filmography of Satoshi Kon - a thrilling series of funhouse mirrors and puzzlebox narratives that proved what is possible in the animation form.

We’re talking about famous “bad girl” transitions in pop history. We’re talking about Digimon villains. We’re talking about obsessive fandoms. And, most crucially, we learn a new piece of Ben lore that involves a famous reality tv star.

      <title>Basic with BenDavid Grabinski</title>
      <description>Our McTiernan series concludes with 2003’s BASIC - a film that Griffin thinks should instead be titled “COMPLICATED” - get it? Because there are so many plot twists?? The great BenDavid Grabinski joins us to chat about John Travolta’s run of big, skeezy characters post-FACE/OFF, McTiernan’s ultimate Achilles heel (getting too confident in his ability to fix impossible movies), the screenwriting career of studio wunderkind James Vanderbilt, and the truly terrible acting of Giovanni Ribisi. Plus, the return of Journalist Eddie Brock, our pitches for different versions of CHANGING LANES (which they should remake every five years), and our final McT filmography rankings.

      <description>Finally, we arrive at the film that helped put John McTiernan in both “director jail” and “jail jail” - the incoherent nu-metal fart that is 2002’s ROLLERBALL. Zach Cherry continues his trend of appearing on episodes covering movies that led to actual court cases, and we do our best to try to explain what happened (both on-screen and off). Why is this film set in Borat’s Kazakhstan? What was up with the extended nightvision scene? Is Griffin insane for being a Chris Kline apologist? Plus - Ben learns about the World Nomad Games of Central Asia!

      <title>The 13th Warrior with David Lowery</title>
      <description>What if there was a 13th Warrior? What if there was a version of Beowulf so grounded in reality that the climactic battle with Grendel just kind of felt like a shrug? What if Antonio Banderas was the lead in Gladiator instead of Russell Crowe? We’re just asking questions! Filmmaker David Lowery makes his long-awaited return to the podcast to talk about John McTiernan’s Michael Crichton adaptation, a movie that should have kept the title of the original book - Eaters of the Dead. Such a sick title! Anyway, prepare yourself for plenty of Banderas talk, a loving deep-dive into the famous “Banderas learns the Viking language” scene, and a reveal of some Blank Check-related easter eggs in Lowery’s filmography (!).

      <title>The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) with Amanda Dobbins</title>
      <description>A Fiji water bottle. “Sinnerman” by Nina Simone. That Magritte painting with the bowler hat. A SCINTILLATING, AGE-APPROPRIATE ROMANCE WITH TWO OF THE GREATEST HEIST SEQUENCES IN MOVIE HISTORY. We’re talking Tommy C (1999), baby! The delightful Amanda Dobbins joins us for her long-awaited Blank Check debut, and this episode is about as fun as you’d expect. Do we think this movie is better than the Norman Jewison original? Yes. Do we go long on the filmography of Rene Russo? Yes. Do we explain how Pierce Brosnan fit the Monet canvas into his briefcase? Sort of. Does Amanda know the plot of “Wicked”? Surprisingly, no!

      <title>Die Hard with a Vengeance with Shea Serrano</title>
      <description>John McTiernan back with the Die Hard franchise after the spectacular flop of Last Action Hero. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson back together after Pulp Fiction. Die Hard with a Vengeance is definitely part of the “we are so back” canon. Shea Serrano (who owns every McTiernan movie on VHS) joins us to chat about this explosive action threequel that features a surprising amount of New York theater actors and a bunch of childhood games and riddles. Also, you don’t need us to tell you this but - Jeremy Irons hot. Also cool.

      <title>Last Action Hero with Paul Scheer &amp; Jason Mantzoukas</title>
      <description>You either love this movie or you hate it, and guess what - we’re landing all over the LOST ACTION HERO spectrum this episode! Paul Scheer &amp; Jason Mantzoukas join us once again for a clock-busting, rip-roaring time, and we’re unpacking all of this movie’s meta madness.  Is John McTiernan able to parody his own work? Should the kid have actually killed people in this movie (as in the original, edgier script)? Will David have an aneurysm if this episode recording doesn’t end at a reasonable time?

Pre-order Paul’s Book

And if anyone has what Jason is looking for, email blankcheckpodcast@gmail.com and well get it to him.

      <title>Medicine Man with Jamie Lee</title>
      <description>Oh baby, this one’s a STINKER! Sean Connery finds the cure for cancer but then he loses it (??). Lorraine Bracco delivers all of her dialogue like someone making a comment and not asking a question at a Q&amp;A. They’re both playing scientists - but where’s the CHEMISTRY?? Comedian and writer Jamie Lee returns to Blank Check to talk about John McTiernan’s attempt at a serious adult drama, 1992’s MEDICINE MAN. We spend most of the episode trying to recast this movie to make it somewhat palatable. But the musical score is great!

Lorraine Bracco delivers all of her dialogue like someone making a comment and not asking a question at a Q&amp;A. They’re both playing scientists - but where’s the CHEMISTRY?? Comedian and writer Jamie Lee returns to Blank Check to talk about John McTiernan’s attempt at a serious adult drama, 1992’s MEDICINE MAN. We spend most of the episode trying to recast this movie to make it somewhat palatable. But the musical score is great!

The Blankies (and host Griffy Crystal) are back! Joe Reid of “This Had Oscar Buzz” joins us once again to celebrate the momentous year in cinema that was 2023. We’re handing out fake awards, making outrageous claims, and we’ve got a special musical performance that brings the house down. Enjoy!

      <title>Die Hard with Kevin Smith</title>
      <description>Thirty-six floors. Thirteen (fake) terrorists. One perfect action movie. Kevin Smith - who was in a Die Hard movie AND directed Alan Rickman in DOGMA -  joins us again for a supersized episode on McTiernan’s signature film. We’re getting into Bruce's wine cooler commercials. We reveal the surprising Shakespeare play that influenced McTiernan’s direction of this story. We’re nerding out about the spatial and organizational PERFECTION that makes it such a classic. And we’re paying loving homage to two screen presences whose careers ended tragically too soon.

For almost three hours, we’re dissecting every little bit of PREDATOR - the glow-stick goo alien blood, the Alan Silvestri score, Arnold’s calves, Arnold’s biceps, Arnold’s long red polo shirt, Arnold’s chiseled cheekbones, the way Arnold says KILL ME!!! - you can expect lots of Arnold talk.

      <title>Nomads</title>
      <description>Okay, action freaks! We’re kicking off our John McTiernan miniseries - POD HARD WITH A VENGECAST - with a film that is not at all indicative of the greatness to come. Nomads! A movie where Pierce Brosnan attempts a garbage French accent and is terrified by some punks in a van. That’s kind of the whole thing. Anyway - get ready for a spirited conversation about plenty of other topics, like: the filmography of Tom Shadyac! John McTiernan’s super cool dad! Gerard Depardieu’s face! The strict rules of Julliard! The 1976 Academy Awards! And more!

      <title>The Mirror Has Two Faces with Bobby Finger &amp; Lindsey Weber</title>
      <description>If Yentl was about connecting with her absent father, and The Prince of Tides was about forgiving her difficult mother, The Mirror Has Two Faces is just about BARBRA! Who Weekly’s Bobby Finger and Lindsay Weber join us as we close out our Streisand series with her final film, a strange Frankenstein of a Judd Apatow, Albert Brooks, and Nora Ephron romcom. Should Lauren (“Betty”) Bacall have won the Oscar that year? Should Pierce Brosnan and Jeff Bridges have swapped roles? Is “the perfect bite” the ideal romcom concept? Is Barbra Streisand actually lazy, as she claims she is? Do we have any listeners who keep snoballs in their drawers?

      <title>The Prince of Tides with Katey Rich</title>
      <description>Can you hear the crawdads sing? Or is that just our Nick Nolte impression? Our favorite Carolinian Katey Rich joins us to chat about Streisand’s 1991 adaptation of Pat Conroy’s bugnuts novel, a story that includes some serious ethical breaches made by alluring therapist Susan Lowenstein. Listen along as Katey shares some tidbits from the book that did NOT make the screen adaptation (a tiger, for example), Griffin relates to Jason Gould’s attempts to be sporty, and David offers his hot take that this is a better 90s therapy movie than Good Will Hunting.

      <title>Yentl with Jordan Hoffman</title>
      <description>Podcast, can you hear me?” We certainly can, Barbra! The very menschy Jordan Hoffman joins us to chat about Streisand’s official directorial debut, a marvel of a film that makes anyone describing it sound insane. Yes, Barbra wrote, directed, produced, and starred in a period piece about a shtetl girl who crossdresses in order to study the Talmud. Yes, the film is a musical with songs composed by Michel Legrand. Yes, Barbra is the only person who sings in it, despite the male lead being Broadway legend Mandy Patinkin. Yes, Steven Spielberg called this movie “the greatest directorial debut since CITIZEN KANE.” Yes, we think Barbra should enter the MCU and direct Ant Man 4. Wait, what?

      <title>A Star Is Born (1976) with Rachel Zegler</title>
      <description>Hello Gorgeous! We’re kicking off our Barbra Streisand series (titled “Podcastl,” naturally) with a look at her version of the classic Hollywood cautionary tale - 1976’s A STAR IS BORN. And who better to join us than our own songbird superstar - the lovely Rachel Zegler! While Babs didn’t technically direct this one, she and her partner Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper in LICORICE PIZZA, duh) exacted supreme creative control over the project - to mixed results. Join us as we trace the beginning of Streisand’s career, go down several rabbit holes of who else was considered for this movie (Elvis, Sonny and Cher), and speak fondly about Mariah Carey’s GLITTER. Because, why not?!

      <title>Ferrari with Bilge Ebiri</title>
      <description>Vroom vroom! Michael Mann is BACK. Bilge Ebiri is BACK. How do you say “we’re so back” in Italian? Join us as we talk about cars that go fast (Ferraris), hair that grows long (Adam Driver’s, normally), faces that have seen smart phones (Shailene Woodley’s) and character actors that could have been in this movie (Paul Giamatti, but specifically as Pig Vomit). Masculinity is a cage, machines that work the best are the most beautiful, and we all think that the Mille Miglia seems like a bad idea. No grazie!

      <title>Maestro with Marie Bardi-Salinas</title>
      <description>The music! The makeup! The MAESTRO! We’re diving into Bradley Cooper’s Leonard Bernstein biopic, the result of his post-A STAR IS BORN Blank Check, and we’re getting personal, emotional, and pretty ridiculous. Who does Griffin’s Bernstein impression sound like (because it certainly doesn’t sound like Bernstein)? What is Ben’s familial connection to the Maestro? Will Marie ever forgive Griffin for inviting Bobby Wagner on a date to visit Bradley Cooper’s Philly cheesesteak truck instead of her? Will David ever forgive Griffin for comparing the Maestro to Will Smith?

Theme music by Alex Barron

Music selection "We Three Kings" by Amy Irving, Goolis, Aaron Is Your Friend from Slow Xmas 3.

      <title>The Boy and the Heron with J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>It took seven years for Hayao Miyazaki and the artists at Studio Ghibli to make THE BOY AND THE HERON. What better way to honor that lengthy process than to invite JD Amato back for another clockbusting, context-loaded episode?! For a rather bit-free THREE-AND-A-HALF HOURS, we are diving into Miyazaki’s personal history, his creative process, the differing animation styles between the Ghibli greats, and the thematic implications of this beautiful new film. Because this is Blank Check, we’ve also got lots of thoughts on Robert Pattinson’s vocal performance, and a lot to say about some other, less-successful animated films released this year.

      <title>I Love You to Death</title>
      <description>Mamma mia! We’ve got-a some-a sleepy pasta for-a you to taste-a this-a week! In our latest, much-awaited installment of PORCH CLASSICS, we’re handing the reins to Producer Ben, who has chosen to spotlight a forgotten comedy about “the world’s horniest pizza man who cannot die.” Lawrence Kasdan’s I LOVE YOU TO DEATH is a feast of bizarre performances (Italian-face Kevin Kline, Serb-face Joan Plowright, Stoner-face William Hurt) and tonal miscalculations. All this to say - it’s a very FUN movie to talk about.

      <description>We’re wrapping up our Fincher series with his latest release - a stripped-down, gig-economy hitman thriller - THE KILLER. Is Michael Fassbender’s unnamed hitman actually good at his job, or a total goober? How do your friends at Blank Check feel about The Smiths? Where do the Two Friends put MANK in their final Fincher rankings? And - is Griffin okay, or has he fallen too deep inside the Gaylor Swift rabbit hole?

Is Michael Fassbender’s unnamed hitman actually good at his job, or a total goober? How do your friends at Blank Check feel about The Smiths? Where do the Two Friends put MANK in their final Fincher rankings? And - is Griffin okay, or has he fallen too deep inside the Gaylor Swift rabbit hole?</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Mank with Sean Fennessey</title>
      <description>Nerts! Are you folks ready to get MANK-PILLED? We advise that you start by “mankro-dosing” David Fincher’s 2020 exploration of the life and times of cantankerous screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. The Big Picture’s Sean Fennessey joins us to chat about Fincher’s first Netflix feature, and we’re asking all the important questions. Would this film have a better reputation if it had been titled “manK!” ? Will there be a film made 40 years from now entitled “SORK” about Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher, Mark Zuckerberg, and the making of THE SOCIAL NETWORK? Is Mank the “Jabba the Hut of cynicism”? Will Griffin use this episode as another excuse to talk about The Offer?

      <title>Gone Girl with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <description>“Amazing Amy” meets “Awkwardly-Smiling Affleck” in Fincher’s darkly comic masterpiece - an instant classic from that first shot of Rosamund Pike’s pretty head. The delightful Esther Zuckerman (who will definitely NOT “gone girl” her boyfriend) joins us to discuss this impressive work of adaptation. We’re asking all the big questions - is “Amazing Amy” actually a good children’s book? Did Tyler Perry take any directing tips from David Fincher when he made BOO! A MADEA HALLOWEEN? Would this movie work as well with Reese Witherspoon and Jon Hamm as the two leads? Why haven’t we gone long on the career of one Benjamin G. Affleck yet?

      <description>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo? More like The Girl Who Go On Computer! The Girl with the Fruit Tattoo - Fran Hoepfner - joins us as we dive into Fincher’s 2011 Nordic noir. How does Fincher’s take on Stieg Larsson’s international best-seller compare with the original Swedish version? What does Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander have in common with ET? Does Christopher Plummer have the greatest octogenarian acting decade of all time? WHEN WILL BEN HOSLEY MAKE HIS WITCH HACKER MOVIE?

      <title>The Social Network</title>
      <description>Let us take a walk down memory lane to when the Metaverse was but a twinkle in Zuck’s eye, to when Aaron Sorkin was just a much-respected writer and not yet a (groan) director…to when the idea of a prestige film about millennial tech bros seemed like a ludicrous proposition. My, how times have changed! THE SOCIAL NETWORK is one of the most influential and consequential films of the 21st Century - prescient, quotable, and eminently rewatchable. You know what’s cooler than a two hour podcast? A THREE HOUR PODCAST. You’re welcome, nerds.

      <title>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>2007’s THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a film that dares to ask the question, “What if he baby but old?” Despite the meme-ification of David Fincher’s trip to the uncanny valley, we are pleased to make our belated case for why this movie is GOOD, actually, and in step with the themes of Da Finch Man’s body of work - not a sappy outlier. Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson returns to the podcast as we all grapple with mortality, wistfully opine about tugboats, and develop an absurd running bit about late character actor Orson Bean (who is not in this movie). Did you know Producer Ben has been struck by lightning seven times?

      <title>Zodiac with Leslye Headland</title>
      <description>This is the Zodiac speaking. I have recorded this podcast episode with Griffin, David, and the genius Leslye Headland because I am tired of the tangents on every other episode so far this Fincher series. With this episode, we’re getting into the CRAFT, the OBSESSION, the MADNESS, the MINUTIAE of David Fincher’s Gordian knot of a true crime mystery. What is the scariest scene in ZODIAC? Which of the three main actors gives the best performance? Are Aqua Velvas good? Like my identity, there is no definitive answer to these questions. The untangling is the juice, baby!

      <title>Panic Room with Eva Anderson</title>
      <description>We’re scootin’ through some wild Manhattan real estate this week and locking ourselves into David Fincher’s PANIC ROOM with the wonderful Eva Anderson! Can you believe that Jodie Foster wasn’t even supposed to be in this movie? And that David Fincher was the one who braided Jared Leto’s cornrows? Just kidding about that last one. Come for Griffin’s formative crush on young Kristen Stewart, stay for the inexplicable amount of talk about “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” - a show that has absolutely nothing to do with this movie.

      <title>Fight Club with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>The first rule of Fight Club? Don’t talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club? DON’T TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB. For those of you who like following the rules, we have an edited version of this episode available on Patreon wherein we do NOT talk about the seminal 1999 film FIGHT CLUB. But for the rest of you sickos, we’ve got a supersized episode with Project Mayhem’s own Alex Ross Perry. In this episode, we discuss our picks for the iconic DVDs of the “DVD era”, dive into the career of SERIOUS ACTOR Edward Norton, wonder what this movie would have been like with Janeane Garofalo as Marla Singer, and reveal the very dumb reason why Fred Durst is a playable character in the Fight Club video game.

This episode is sponsored by:
NO ONE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT OUR JOBS. WE ARE NOT OUR ADVERTISERS. HIS NAME IS ROBERT PAULSON.

      <title> The Game with Brendan Hines</title>
      <description>Congratulations! If you are listening to this episode, it means you’ve discovered the key in the mouth of the wooden clown we placed in your driveway. Actor, musician, and handsome man Brendan Hines joins us this week as we lead you on an immersive, life-changing experience through David Fincher’s The Game. We understand you may have some questions. How much did this whole thing cost? Is cocaine a requirement for every Michael Douglas movie? What’s Deborah Kara Unger up to these days? Did Charles Martinet say “it’s a-meeee, daddio!” when he jumped off the roof? We will try our best to answer these enquiries, but please note that CRS is not liable to disclose all of its innerworkings to clients.

      <title> Se7en with Mike Mitchell &amp; Nick Wiger</title>
      <description>Who loves Da Finchman? These guys do! MTV Movie Award-losing duo Mitch and Nick of the Doughboys join us to talk about David Fincher’s breakthrough hit - the nasty noir SE7EN. What can you expect from this episode? Lots of talk about “playground rumors” related to what this movie does and doesn’t actually show, a full taxonomy of Kevin Spacey’s on-screen persona, the true identity of the Zodiac killer, and a VERY Doughboys description of the film’s “gluttony” murder.

      <title>Alien³ with Matt Singer</title>
      <description>The time has come for us to talk about one of the most successful, most influential, most respected American filmmakers of the past 30 years. That’s right, we’re talking about the director of ALIEN3, David “Da Finchman” Fincher! We’re kicking off “The Curious Pod of Benjamin Buttcast” in style, pressing play on our Alien Quadrilogy Blu-Ray with guest Matt Singer - and you better believe we’re watching the “extended cut” in “Mu-th-ur Mode”! Join us as we give some light background on young “Dave” Fincher, alleged neighbor of George Lucas and director of Madonna music videos and smoking fetus PSAs. We’re going long on the troubled production of ALIEN 3 - a franchise film that has such disdain for its audience that we can’t help but love and respect it. No Newt? NO PROBLEMO. Do you want to do the dance with Charles Dance? So do we!

      <title>Decision to Leave with Tatiana Maslany</title>
      <description>Decision to Leave? More like, decision to watch a good movie! EMMY AWARD WINNER (but more importantly, David Sims Best Supporting Actress Nominee of 2017) joins us to discuss Park’s most recent film, a romantic noir that gets text messaging absolutely right. We’re getting into everything, from the complexities of Tang Wei’s performance, to the concept of “sand beaching,” to S. Craig Zahler’s tight ponytail. Plus, we give our final Park rankings, and announce our next series, the worst-kept secret in podcasting.

      <title> The Handmaiden with Emily Yoshida</title>
      <description>We couldn’t be more excited to talk about the film we consider to be Park’s masterpiece - the gorgeous, twisty, and ultimately moving THE HANDMAIDEN. “Mother of the Blankies” Emily Yoshida joins us to unpack this puzzlebox of an erotic thriller, a brilliant adaptation of Sarah Waters’ Fingersmith. Come for the coining of a new Blank Check phrase (thanks, researcher JJ!), stay for a very crucial “touch of the Tucc” tangent. By the way - what does that octopus actually do??

      <title>Stoker with Emily St. James</title>
      <description>Remember when the star of TV’s Prison Break (Wentworth Miller, “human map”) wrote a screenplay that landed on the Black List and ended up serving as the material for Park Chan-Wook’s only English film to date? What a time to be alive! Mia Wasikowska superfan Emily St. James returns to Blank Check to offer her take on 2013’s Stoker, a movie that is not NOT about vampires. Join us as we fawn over Park’s stunning directorial choices (that shot where Nicole Kidman’s hair transitions into grass!), go long on 2000s TV series (Prison Break obviously, but also In Treatment), and listen with delight as Emily shares some crucial David Sims lore.

      <title>Thirst with Hoai-Tran Bui</title>
      <description>Move over, Dracula. Eat your heart out Edward Cullen. A new sexy vampire is in town, and he just happens to be a PRIEST! Park Chan-Wook reunites with the wonderful Song Kang-ho to put his own stamp on the popular genre with 2009’s THIRST. Inverse’s Hoi-Tran Boi joins us to chat about this darkly funny (and devilishly sound-designed) film, an adaptation of Emile Zola’s classic novel Thérèse Raquin. How do the rules of vampirism translate to a culture where everything is cooked with garlic?

      <title>I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK with Karen Chee</title>
      <description>From the twisted mind of Park Chan-Wook, it’s…a surprisingly sensitive romance set in a mental hospital? Writer and Comedian Karen Chee joins us to chat about 2006’s I’M A CYBORG, BUT THAT’S OKAY - a real outlier in Park’s career, and a commercial disappointment after the global success of his Vengeance Trilogy. Would it surprise you to learn that this film was inspired by, of all things, TOY STORY? Is this the best Park film to remake with a cast of Muppets? Are any of the film’s mental illnesses based in reality? All that, and more, in a very silly episode.

      <itunes:summary>From the twisted mind of Park Chan-Wook, it’s…a surprisingly sensitive romance set in a mental hospital? Writer and Comedian Karen Chee joins us to chat about 2006’s I’M A CYBORG, BUT THAT’S OKAY - a real outlier in Park’s career, and a commercial disappointment after the global success of his Vengeance Trilogy. Would it surprise you to learn that this film was inspired by, of all things, TOY STORY? Is this the best Park film to remake with a cast of Muppets? Are any of the film’s mental illnesses based in reality? All that, and more, in a very silly episode.

      <title>Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One with Marie Bardi</title>
      <description>It’s 2023. An all-powerful AI program named “the Entity” is sewing chaos and threatening the fragile equilibrium of the world as we know it. It is also throwing sick parties. Meanwhile, over at Blank Check HQ, the BENTITY has a few tricks up his sleeve to surprise Griffin, David, and Marie with a mission of their own as they break down Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie’s latest big-screen extravaganza.

Special thanks to IMF team members Teo Rapp-Olsson and Patrick Willems. Support their work!

      <title>Sympathy for Lady Vengeance with Karen Han</title>
      <description>Park Chan-Wook’s loosely-linked “Vengeance Trilogy” comes to a starkly satisfying end with 2005’s LADY VENGEANCE - a normal flick…that’s all we have to say! Just kidding - we have LOTS to say about this one, with its stacked cast of lady convicts and grief-stricken parents. Our beloved Karen Han returns to the pod to correct our terrible Korean pronunciations and to tell us about “Jump Like A Witch” - a Korean reality series wherein famous female celebrities attempt to form a basketball team. Plus - it should surprise no one that this episode contains plenty of Pirates of the Caribbean discussion.

      <description>What is an Oldboy? How do you feel about Greek Tragedies? How did Choi Min-Sik achieve that iconic (and insane) hairstyle?

All those questions answered and more as critic Alison Willmore joins us to talk about OLDBOY, the first major Korean breakthrough in the American filmbro canon.

      <title>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance with David Ehrlich</title>
      <description>Park Chan-Wook kicks off his famous “Vengeance” trilogy and we kick off another episode where we talk about Ted Danson’s late 90s sitcom BECKER! Critic, friend of the pod, and Crystal Skull-apologist David Ehrlich joins us to chat about Park’s “Sympathy for Mister Vengeance” - a film that shows that revenge is not a dish best served cold, but is actually kind of sad and futile. Come for Ehrlich’s story about his teen trip to Seoul (when he had lunch with Director Park!), stay for the throwback memories of ordering imported DVDs from YesAsia-dot-com and the often misleading branding of the Tartan Asian EXTREME label.

        <![CDATA[<p>Park Chan-Wook kicks off his famous “Vengeance” trilogy and we kick off another episode where we talk about Ted Danson’s late 90s sitcom BECKER! Critic, friend of the pod, and Crystal Skull-apologist David Ehrlich joins us to chat about Park’s “Sympathy for Mister Vengeance” - a film that shows that revenge is not a dish best served cold, but is actually kind of sad and futile. Come for Ehrlich’s story about his teen trip to Seoul (when he had lunch with Director Park!), stay for the throwback memories of ordering imported DVDs from YesAsia-dot-com and the often misleading branding of the Tartan Asian EXTREME label.</p><p><br></p><p>Guest Links: </p><p><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/author/david-ehrlich/">Read Ehrlich’s writing at IndieWire</a></p><p><a href="https://fightinginthewarroom.com/">Listen to Fighting in The War Room</a></p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/user92154201">Watch Ehrlich’s Best of Videos</a></p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Moon Is…the Sun's Dream / Trio</title>
      <description>It’s a brand new era for Blank Check - Griffin is in his “arriving early to work” era. Ben is in his “Bad Boy 2.0” era. And we’re all in our WORLD CINEMA era as we kick off our series on South Korean master (and March Madness champion!) Park Chan-Wook. Join us as we offer a brief overview of the evolution of Korean cinema - from 1960’s landmark THE HOUSEMAID up through decades of government censorship - and introduce the career of one of our finest filmmakers. However - we’re gonna be real with you all. Park’s first two movies are NOT GOOD. He has actively tried to erase them from the cultural consciousness. So - do things get really silly as we dance around talking about how bad these movies are? YES. Do we use this episode as an excuse to catch up with several series worth of Ben Nicknames? ABSOLUTELY.

      <title>The Cameraman / Spite Marriage</title>
      <description>Our Buster Keaton series comes to a conclusion as his period of creative independence does, with his first two features for MGM: THE CAMERAMAN and SPITE MARRIAGE. The former? Debatably a meta-masterpiece, with a Chinatown setpiece for the ages and one very adorable monkey. The latter? Well, you can see the downward spiral start to take shape. In this episode, we fill in the later years of Buster’s life and career, give our final Keaton rankings, and attempt to cheer Ben up after a very demoralizing restaurant experience.

      <title>College / Steamboat Bill, Jr. with John Hodgman</title>
      <description>After his “blank check” for THE GENERAL bounced,  Buster Keaton found himself creatively and financially shackled. Thus, 1927’s COLLEGE lands on the lesser end of the quality spectrum (not to mention a very difficult watch with Buster putting on blackface for a scene - yikes). But, his follow-up STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. features some of the most memorable and dangerous stunts of Keaton’s career, and acts as a beautiful send-off to his period as a self-sufficient filmmaker. The wonderful John Hodgman joins us to chat about both films and his life-long love of Buster. Plus - as always with a Hodgman episode - we go down several delightful rabbit holes: Doctor Who, beans, Goofy’s “George Geef” period, large pants, and more!

      <title>Battling Butler / The General with Jamelle Bouie</title>
      <description>One of narrative cinema’s earliest training sequences, and one of cinema’s most famous trains - that’s right, we’re covering Buster Keaton’s 1926 films BATTLING BUTLER and THE GENERAL. Gentleman, scholar, and action movie aficionado Jamelle Bouie joins us to unpack this week’s double feature, providing some essential historical context for THE GENERAL’s unfortunate Civil War  setting. Plus, Ben starts researching how one buys a train.

      <title>Seven Chances / Go West with Jamie Loftus</title>
      <description>This week’s Keaton double feature sees our unflappable hero chased by two types of terrifying crowds: angry would-be brides, and a herd of cattle. How does he outrun them both? Jamie Loftus joins us to chat about Buster Keaton’s tremendous on-screen running (up there with Tom Cruise), his enduring sex appeal (we love a hot tired guy), and his compassion for animals (giving the bovine star of GO WEST a week off to have sex). Plus, because Jamie is THE Hot Dog Queen, we get into a very involved, very long tangent about the world of competitive Hot Dog Eating.

      <title>Sherlock Jr. / The Navigator with James Urbaniak</title>
      <description>Buster Keaton released two features in 1924 - “Sherlock Jr.”, a film that was considered a commercial disappointment at the time but has grown in stature over the past century, and “The Navigator'', a colossal box office hit that hasn’t aged nearly as well. Actor and lover of old-timey things James Urbaniak makes his long-awaited debut on the pod (originally promised back in our Shyamalan days!) and we’re getting into the billiards bits, boat gags, razor puns, and movie magic that make this double feature so special.

Guest Links: 
See James in The Country Club as well as Venture Bros: Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart when they come out.

      <title>Three Ages / Our Hospitality with Dana Stevens</title>
      <description>The Great Stone Face…The Little Boy Who Couldn’t Be Damaged…whatever you call him, Buster Keaton is one of the most important figures in film history, and we couldn’t be happier to be spotlight him in our latest series PODCAST JR. Our beloved Dana Stevens - writer of the fantastic Keaton tome “Camera Man” - joins us to set the table as we dive into the filmography of one of Griffin’s favorite artists. We’re going into Buster’s start as a vaudeville child star (sometimes in “Irish face”), the qualities of his work that distinguish him from peers Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd, and we’re dissecting the gags and stunts featured in his first two feature films. Plus - Griffin gives one of his worst Box Office Game performances, and we all learn a bit about early child labor laws.

      <title>Yesterday with Zach Cherry</title>
      <description>Our Danny Boyle series comes to an end with a mind-bending movie that dares to ask the question, “What if The Beatles didn’t exist?” Severance’s Zach Cherry makes his long-overdue first appearance on the pod to profess his love Boyle’s most recent film, while David nearly has a stroke from trying to wrap his brain around all its logic loops. We’re asking all the big questions - if the Beatles never existed, would Charles Manson? If cigarettes never existed, how would that change the colonization of the New World? If John Lennon is alive in this universe, does this mean that Paul is actually dead? When does Ana de Armas show up?

      <title>T2 Trainspotting with Scott Aukerman &amp; Shaun Diston</title>
      <description>First they were addicted to heroin, now they’re addicted to *nostalgia* (but also still heroin)! Danny Boyle returns to the squalid Scottish world of Renton, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie for T2: Trainspotting, and Scott Aukerman and Sprague (aka the Artist Formerly Known as Shaun Diston) join us to talk about this under-seen legacy sequel. How did Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor’s real-life feud influence this film? Is Spud’s arc in this basically just Bubbles’ arc in season 5 of The Wire? Which is the better “much-later sequel starring Ewan McGregor in an iconic role” - this, or the Obi Wan Kenobi series on Disney+?

How did Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor’s real-life feud influence this film? Is Spud’s arc in this basically just Bubbles’ arc in season 5 of The Wire? Which is the better “much-later sequel starring Ewan McGregor in an iconic role” - this, or the Obi Wan Kenobi series on Disney+?</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Steve Jobs with Olivia Craighead</title>
      <description>Calling all Sorkinistas - we’re walking, talking, and putting 1,000 songs in your pocket! Based on Walter Isaccson’s best-selling biography of the original Apple Genius, STEVE JOBS puts Danny Boyle in David Fincher’s shoes. What did we learn about this movie from the notorious Sony hacks? Is Michael Fassbender too hot to play Steve Jobs? Would it surprise you to learn that Ben Hosley is a life-long Mac user? Olivia Craighead returns to the pod and joins the Five Timers Club in spectacular fashion with a special throwback burger report. Plus - we do NOT thank the Apple II team, and David has strep.

      <title>Trance with Nia DaCosta</title>
      <description>Probably the only film in history to hinge on the shaving of pubic hair as crucial plot point, Danny Boyle’s 2013 film TRANCE is…certainly something! Filmmaker Nia DaCosta takes a break from post-production on THE MARVELS to return to the podcast as we peel back the layers of this twisty hypnosis thriller. What is this movie actually trying to say? We don’t know. However, we *do* know that Vincent Cassel is wayyyy sexy, and that the film’s notorious electric razor sound effect was an unforgivable mistake.

      <title>127 Hours with Sean Clements</title>
      <description>Welcome to another installment in the “If This Happened to Ben Hosley, It Wouldn’t Have Gone Down Like That” series of films - it’s 127 HOURS! Hollywood Handbook’s Sean Clements returns to the pod as we all discuss what we would do if, like real-life outdoorsman Aron Ralston, we got literally “stuck between a rock and a hard place.” What is gnarlier - cutting off your own arm, drinking your own pee, or hosting the Oscars the same year you get your first acting nomination and completely self-sabotaging during it? James Franco, we’re looking at you.

      <description>Danny Boyle is about to win the Oscar. How did he do it? A) He Cheated, B) He’s Lucky, C) He’s a Genius, D) IT IS WRITTEN. Critic Siddhant Adlakha joins us to dissect the improbable success of Boyle’s 2008 Dickens-by-way-of-Mumbai hit SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. We’re getting into everything, from the film’s reputation in India to the 2009 Oscar ceremony with Hugh Jackman, from UK teen TV sensation “Skins” to the unexpected success of “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” in primetime. Jai Ho!

      <title>Sunshine</title>
      <description>The time has come for us to board the Icarus II (awful name for a spaceship) and stare directly into the sun. First mentioned as a movie that rules way back when we were only a podcast about the Star Wars Prequels, Griffin and David finally get to cover Danny Boyle’s 2007 Science Fiction flop SUNSHINE. We’re getting into everything - the iconic score, the brilliantly restrictive use of colors, the hot scientist named Brian Cox (not Logan Roy) who served as a model for Cillian Murphy’s character, and the film’s very controversial third act. Staring into the sun? Bad idea. Taking the time to re-appraise this forgotten gem? A GREAT ONE.

      <title>Millions with Adam Kempenaar</title>
      <description>How did Danny Boyle choose to follow up the ultraviolence of 28 Days Later? With a winsome kid’s movie about morality and currency conversion, of course! Filmspotting’s Adam Kempenaar joins us to revisit 2004’s Millions, which he originally covered in the second episode of Filmspotting back in 2005 (!) Why did Danny Boyle want to make a family-friendly film? Should this have been a musical? Was there ever a point in time where it seemed like Britain would adopt the Euro?

      <title>28 Days Later with David Rees</title>
      <description>Fast zombies, a deserted London, and potato-quality digital cinematography - 28 DAYS LATER proved to be a genre-defining hit for Danny Boyle after the disappointment of THE BEACH. Humorist and Blankie favorite David Rees returns to the podcast to take us back to the immediate post-9/11 period, a mood and time which this film conjures instantly. Join us for a deep dive into the zombie canon, a tangent on the famed “Young British Artists” of the 1990s, a primer on Canadian anti-capitalist band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and a moment of disbelief when Rees discovers that Brendan Gleeson played Donald Trump in Showtime’s THE COMEY RULE.

      <title>The Beach with Emily Yoshida</title>
      <description>Mother is back, and she’s taking us all to THE BEACH! Emily Yoshida makes her long-awaited return to the pod to speak about her experience in the writer’s room of the still-unproduced TV version of Alex Garland’s titular novel. We’re asking all the big questions - when did Leonardo DiCaprio stop being “baby” and become a big boy on screen? Why is no one practicing ethical non-monogamy or doing heroin on this island? Is it cool to like Moby again after that weird Natalie Portman thing? How would starring in this movie have affected Ewan McGregor’s career? Why stay in a commune with a bunch of dirty European hippies when you could just go to a resort with real bathrooms?

      <title>A Life Less Ordinary with Janet Varney</title>
      <description>After the smashing success of TRAINSPOTTING, Danny Boyle reteamed with star Ewan McGregor and writer John Hodge to…make a movie where Dan Hedaya plays the Archangel Gabriel, Stanley Tucci plays a cuck dentist, and Ewan has one of the worst haircuts in the history of cinema? Shockingly, 1997’s A LIFE LESS ORDINARY was not a hit. Actress and comedian Janet Varney (The Legend of Korra, “The JV Club”) joins us as we attempt to make sense of this bizarro road trip romance.

      <title>Trainspotting with Charles Rogers</title>
      <description>The UK’s answer to PULP FICTION, Danny Boyle’s TRAINSPOTTING exploded into theaters and became a global phenomenon, thanks to an iconic marketing campaign. Who *didn’t* have this poster up in their dorm room? “Search Party” creator Charles Rogers returns to the pod to talk about how his own dorm TRAINSPOTTING poster contributed to his coming out at college, and how Danny Boyle’s radical empathy and fearlessness makes this film so much more than a movie-of-the-week cautionary tale.

      <title>Shallow Grave</title>
      <description>UK house music, a *very* active camera, and Ewan McGregor looking like a SNACK…that’s right, folks - we’re covering Danny Boyle! With the England bit retired, we’re finally giving dual citizen David Sims the time and space to actually reminisce about his very British upbringing. A sensation in the UK upon release, SHALLOW GRAVE introduced Boyle as the cinematic voice of “Cool Britannia” - yet the film remains an under-seen gem in the States. In this episode, the boys discuss what they would do with a dead body (wouldn’t cut it up) and a suitcase of cash (would only skim off the top for a cheeky Nando’s); plus, they gush over the film’s incredible apartment setting…or should we say “flat”?

      <title>Wendell &amp; Wild</title>
      <description>Henry Selick waited thirteen years to make his follow-up to CORALINE, and it feels like we’ve been waiting even longer to hear David’s TIFF Airbnb story - a yarn that finally gets unspooled with the help of friend Shirley Li. After that business is taken care of, we try our best to describe Selick’s WENDELL &amp; WILD - a film that ranks among the more convoluted of the movies we’ve covered on the pod. Yet - we still find a lot to love about this tale of demons, hair creme, and private prisons! Stop motion puppets that look just like Key, Peele, AND James Hong! Esteemed British character actor David Harewood as Black Trump! And Ben shines a special spotlight on the film’s killer soundtrack.

      <title>Coraline with J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>The ultimate connoisseur of context, the guru of camera gear - our friend JD Amato makes his triumphant return to the main feed to walk us through the magic and genius of Henry Selick’s masterpiece CORALINE. For listeners who never had the chance to catch this film in its original 3D release, we attempt to describe Selick’s absolute mastery of the form. We go long on the history of Laika studios, from Will Vinton’s California raisins, to the ultimate “nepo baby” Travis Knight’s (aka “Chilly T”) ascension to the throne. Plus - JD discovers a tiny door in our new recording studio…

      <title>Avatar: The Way of Water with Marie Bardi</title>
      <description>The gang went to see AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER and we all got soaking wet. Fully submerged. Drenched! We’re communing with space whales, chugging coffees with Edie Falco, and learning how to hold our breath for long stretches of time to commemorate the release of James Cameron’s long-awaited sequel to the biggest movie of all time. Are we one with Eywa now? How does Kate Winslet’s Na’vi accent stack up against her previous linguistic efforts? Is the Regal Cinemas Agave Aquarita the perfect cocktail to accompany your trip back to Pandora? Will Marie end up buying the Lego “Home Tree” set, or is that too complicated for the crew?

Plus, check out the Slow Xmas 2022 holiday music compilation now on Spotify and Bandcamp! Please support the bands/artists featured on this album.

      <title>Monkeybone with Justin McElroy</title>
      <description>Just in time for Brendan Fraser’s big comeback, we’re taking a look back at his misguided collaboration with Henry Selick - 2001’s bizarro flop MONKEYBONE. Justin McElroy (no relation to Bridget Fonda’s Dr. Julie McElroy) returns to the podcast after having watched this film a whopping seven times (!!) to unpack all the madness. Why are there no rules or logic to the film’s “Dark Town” underworld? What was the appeal of Chris Kattan’s “Mango” character on SNL? Was this film the nail in the coffin for the kitschy retro-revival genre of projects that dominated the 1990s? Can we write the money we spent to rent this movie off on our taxes?

      <title>The Nightmare Before Christmas with Michael Rianda</title>
      <description>We’re wearing our Hot Topic sweatshirts and enunciating every dramatic syllable to pay tribute to one of the greatest animated films of all time - Tim Burton’s (but really Henry Selick’s) THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. Academy Award-nominated animator and Blankie Michael Rianda (THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES) joins us to talk about this multi-holiday classic, which is basically just a movie about a creative weirdo trying to fit in at Disney. Is this the boniest movie we’ve covered on the podcast? Does Halloween Town have the best minor background characters since the Mos Eisley cantina? What is the St. Patrick’s Day Town like?

      <title>The Fabelmans</title>
      <description>For the first time in years, both Griffin and David are in agreement on a new Steven Spielberg film - what a picture! We’re playing both film critics and armchair psychologists in this episode as we unpack THE FABELMANS, a movie that is less sentimental and more complex than one would assume based on the poster. What sets this film apart from the ever-growing stack of filmmaker origin stories? Is this the de-facto Best Picture frontrunner? Why the hell was Griffin shooting on super 8 in the early 2000s when MiniDV was available?

      <title>Eyes Wide Shut with David Ehrlich</title>
      <description>Cruise. Kidman. Kubrick. Ehrlich. We’re concluding our Stanley Kubrick series with 1999’s EYES WIDE SHUT and a trip to cinema’s most famous masked orgy. Indiewire’s David Ehrlich joins us as we discuss liminal spaces, the late-90s ABC sitcom “Dharma &amp; Greg,” Nick Nightingale’s skills as a piano player, and Sydney Pollack’s barrel chest. Are there “more Christmas lights in this movie than there are in an NYU student’s dormroom?” What is the platonic ideal of a Tom Cruise hairstyle? Did making this movie kill Kubrick, or was working to finish it what kept him alive? What can one expect to find where the rainbow ends? And more!

        <![CDATA[<p>Cruise. Kidman. Kubrick. Ehrlich. We’re concluding our Stanley Kubrick series with 1999’s EYES WIDE SHUT and a trip to cinema’s most famous masked orgy. Indiewire’s David Ehrlich joins us as we discuss liminal spaces, the late-90s ABC sitcom “Dharma &amp; Greg,” Nick Nightingale’s skills as a piano player, and Sydney Pollack’s barrel chest. Are there “more Christmas lights in this movie than there are in an NYU student’s dormroom?” What is the platonic ideal of a Tom Cruise hairstyle? Did making this movie kill Kubrick, or was working to finish it what kept him alive? What can one expect to find where the rainbow ends?

      <title>Full Metal Jacket with Jon Gabrus</title>
      <description>Alright, maggots, listen up! We’ve got the Action Boy himself - Jon Gabrus - back on the podcast to talk about Kubrick’s bifurcated Vietnam War classic FULL METAL JACKET. We’re retiring the “retired bit” in order to talk about Matthew Modine as Private Joker. We’re getting into the etymology of “poontang.” We’re attempting to articulate what makes a movie feel like an “80s movie” and why this film absolutely doesn’t.  And - we’re gonna end up on a very long tangent about the talking head comedy shows of the mid-aughts. Do we make ourselves clear? SIR, YES, SIR.

      <title>The Shining with Timothy Simons</title>
      <description>Just in time for Halloween, we’re checking into the Overlook Hotel - a haunted place not unlike the Beachwood, Ohio, Homewood Suites that Griffin and guest Timothy Simons stayed in while they were filming DRAFT DAY! Is THE SHINING about Native American genocide, or is it about how Stanley Kubrick thought ghosts were kinda nice? Is Shelley Duvall the MVP of this movie? Would Ben absolutely thrive as the hotel’s caretaker - taking inspiration from the stocked kitchen pantry to whip up some delicious dishes? Why does the spectre of Tim Robinson continue to haunt our Kubrick series?

      <title>Barry Lyndon with Karina Longworth</title>
      <description>NASA-quality lenses, a himbo canon-worthy performance from notoriously “chill and normal guy” Ryan O’Neal, and some flirty ribbon games all combine to make what we consider to be Kubrick’s warmest and most sumptuous film - 1975’s “Barry Lyndon.” Karina Longworth of “You Must Remember This” makes a long-awaited first appearance on the pod to wonder - did Barry actually end up sleeping with his cousin? What are the rules of dueling? Should children be allowed to ride horses? And more!

      <title>A Clockwork Orange with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>Attention all droogs: grab your Nadsat dictionaries and your bowler hats, it’s time to drink some drug-milk! We’ve got our very own Alex - Ross Perry, that is - on the pod to go long on Kubrick’s controversial X-rated dystopian nightmare, 1971’s A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. We’re reminiscing about our rebellious teenage years, which for Alex included a trip to New York to see The Prodigy in concert, and for David included a “Pinter phase.” Did you all know that David grew up in England? Plus - Ben learns that Malcolm McDowell was once married to CLIFFORD’s own Mary Steenburgen, Griffin learns about Kubrick’s preferred brand of storage boxes, and David learns that Alex and Griffin have given him a mysterious new nickname.

      <title>2001: A Space Odyssey with Jordan Hoffman</title>
      <description>Open the pod cast doors, HAL - it’s time for us to talk about one of the most important movies in cinema history. Jordan Hoffman - the friend of the pod who best represents both the “diamond-hard Sci Fi” and psychedelic head-trip factions of 2001 fandom - returns to Blank Check, and we’re doling out the knowledge *and* the giggles. When is the ideal moment to “partake” in order to get the trippiest experience from 2001? Is Griffin starting to change his mind about Kubrick not being funny? Do Arthur C. Clark and Dr. Evil buy their jackets from the same tailor? Is this movie actually all about dick jokes?

      <title>Dr. Strangelove... with Sean Fennessey</title>
      <description>Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here, Sean Fennessey is finally on our podcast! The Big Picture Pod host joins Griffin and David to talk about Kubrick’s razor-sharp satire, the Peter Sellers tour-de-force that is “Dr. Strangelove”. We’re asking all the questions - Could Sellers have played *every* character in this movie? Is the film paradoxically funnier because Kubrick isn’t really a comedy guy? Would George C. Scott hate this podcast? Would you give “Tom Jones” a middling three stars on Letterboxd? And more!

      <title>The Woman King</title>
      <description>It certainly feels great to cover a good movie again! Our mini-run of new releases ends with Gina Prince-Bythewood’s crowd-pleaser - the African female warrior epic “The Woman King”. We’ve got David’s exclusive report on the film’s world premiere at TIFF (humblebrag), a deep dive on the career of Viola Davis (did you know her early industry champions were Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney?), and some thoughts on how this film taps into Prince-Bythewood’s ongoing exploration of chosen families and personal identity.

      <title>Pinocchio (2022) with Podcast: The Ride</title>
      <description>The King of the Uncanny Valley - our boy Bob Zemeckis - is back with his spin on perhaps the most iconic un-real boy in cinema…it’s Pinocchio, baby! Our friends from Podcast: The Ride - two Disney daddies and one small wooden boy - join us to chat about Disney’s latest live-action remake, and we’re mostly just confused. How many days did Tom Hanks spend on set? Why are so many people in Hollywood eager to make their own Pinocchio adaptations? Did Leslie Zemeckis do mo-cap work for the sexy goldfish? Why does Disney World’s Rock ‘N’ Roller Coaster revolve around AEROSMITH of all bands?? We may never know!

      <title>Lolita with Fran Hoepfner</title>
      <description>How did they ever make a podcast of LOLITA? Let’s just say that it wasn’t easy, but thankfully our guest Fran Hoepfner is in her “brave era” and was more than up for the task! If our SPARTACUS episode was full of Tony Curtis impressions, we’re classing up the joint this week with plenty of James Mason bits. In this episode, Ben learns about the Hays Code, Griffin learns how to pronounce “Nabokov,” Fran learns that it is very difficult to eat a giant lollipop, and David learns what everyone thought of his and Forky’s recent wedding.

      <title>Spartacus with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>I am Spartacus! I am Spartacus! Heck, we’re *all* Spartacus today as we talk about the “sword-and-sandals” epic that solidified Stanley Kubrick’s hit-making potential…and soured him on Hollywood forever. Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson returns to the pod and we’re covering all the major topics: How did a young Kubrick manage all the different stars on set - many of whom were accomplished directors in their own right? Was Kirk Douglas’ chin cleft real? Did Dalton Trumbo write the script for this in a bathtub? Why does Tony Curtis always sound like he’s ordering something from a deli?

Why does Tony Curtis always sound like he’s ordering something from a deli?</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>!</p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Paths of Glory with Sarah Marshall</title>
      <description>Perhaps the most humanistic of Kubrick’s films, PATHS OF GLORY is a blistering study of injustice, middle-management, and anti-war sentiment. We’re down in the trenches this week with Sarah Marshall (“You’re Wrong About” and “You Are Good”), and we’re asking the big questions. Like - what crazy scheme did Timothy Carey pull during production that caused him to be fired as soon as all his closeups were filmed? Did Kirk Douglas take his hefty salary (a third of the total budget!) to pay for tennis lessons for son Michael? Why do American schools gloss over World War I? How does Ben weigh his love of ditches against the concept of trench warfare?

      <title>The Killing with Patton Oswalt</title>
      <description>If Stanley Kubrick’s previous two films were exercises in learning on the job, THE KILLING is where we start to see him put that knowledge into action. A thrilling noir, it allowed Kubrick to connect his passion for chess to a story about the best laid plans of a too ambitious crook. We couldn’t be more thrilled to welcome dream guest Patton Oswalt as we swap insane Timothy Carey stories, debate whether or not Rodney Dangerfield appears in the background of a scene, and suggest that Sterling Hayden’s Johnny Clay should have added a “Karen” to his plan to solve his baggage check-in situation at the airport.

      <title>Fear &amp; Desire / Killer's Kiss</title>
      <description>He dominated the field in this year’s 20th Century March Madness competition, and now we’re celebrating with a parade and a big brass band…it’s time for our series on the films of Stanley Kubrick - Pods Wide Cast! Join us as we fill in the background strokes of Kubrick’s early career - his childhood in the Bronx, his photography apprenticeship with Look Magazine - and as we discuss his first two features - 1953’s FEAR AND DESIRE and 1955’s KILLER’S KISS. Some burning questions we end up asking: how much of later Kubrick is already present in these pretty amateurish works? How do these rank in the patheon of debut films by great directors? Is there a code of ethics for cab drivers when you jump into the backseat and request that they “follow that car?” Why has Ben been buying mannequins off eBay? And more!

      <title>Star 80 with Julie Klausner</title>
      <description>Oof - this is a tough one. Incredibly divisive, is “STAR 80” a darkly cynical triumph about the perils of Hollywood and the failings of men? Or is it a too-sympathetic “Portrait of An Incel as a who cares?!” per our guest Julie Klausner? Join us for a very spirited discussion about Fosse’s difficult last film, where we touch upon the dangers of the true crime genre, the tendency for male creatives to prioritize the male perspective, and the ways in which this film complicates the fascinating legacy of Fosse’s collaborative relationships with women. Plus, we offer our final Fosse rankings, and we ponder several tantalizing “what ifs?” about the unrealized projects lost to history after his death in 1987.

      <title>All That Jazz with Lin-Manuel Miranda</title>
      <description>It’s SHOWTIME, folks - and boy, are we jazzed about this episode! Broadway icon and actual Blank Check listener Lin-Manuel Miranda joins us to talk about what many consider to be Bob Fosse’s masterpiece, 1979’s “All That Jazz.” LMM surprises Griffin and David by bringing along an original copy of the film’s script, which offers some fascinating insights into Fosse’s blurring of the lines between memoir and fiction. We discuss the parallels between “All That Jazz” and LMM’s recent screen adaptation of Jonathan Larson’s “tick, tick…BOOM!” - two projects that are concerned with the creation of art in the face of mortality and self-doubt. Plus - Ben gets a very special birthday present.

Plus - Ben gets a very special birthday present. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>!</p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Lenny with Colin Quinn</title>
      <description>Sure, Bob Fosse’s “Lenny” has beautiful cinematography, but does it effectively communicate that Lenny Bruce was funny? Is the narrative of stand-ups as “tortured truth tellers” overdone? 
We have THOUGHTS! Comedian and “stand-up historian” Colin Quinn joins us to talk about the legacy of Lenny Bruce, and what Fosse gets right (the milieu of the clubs, Valerie Perrine’s wonderful performance as Honey Bruce), and what he gets wrong (the actual humor). Plus - we entertain the idea of a miniseries structured not around a specific filmmaker, but a series of late-70s, early-80s films where the main auteur is…cocaine.

      <description>Wilkommen and Bienvenue to our “Cabaret” episode! Literal Disney Princess and musical theater superstar Rachel Zegler joins us to gush over Fosse’s 1972 film - a game-changer for the musical genre, and an Oscar-winning guarantor for Fosse’s cinematic “blank check” after the failure of “Sweet Charity.” Topics discussed include: the differences between the screen version and the stage show; Joel Grey’s Emcee being nearly cut out of the film; Liza Minnelli crafting her own unique look for Sally Bowles; Whether Michael York’s best role was on “Gilmore Girls”; and more!

      <title>Sweet Charity</title>
      <description>The minute you walked in the joint…I could see you were a man of distinction, A REAL PODCASTER! “Pod That Jazzcast” - our series on the films of Bob Fosse - kicks off with a real humdinger of an episode, as the boys discuss 1969’s swinging technicolor musical “Sweet Charity.” For folks unfamiliar with Fosse, we give an overview of his life and career in dance and theater leading up to his film directorial debut, and attempt to decipher his creative obsessions (women, fear of balding, isolated body movements, etc). Plus, Ben realizes he loves musicals, and the boys wonder which brass musical instrument has the most inherent humor.

      <title>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with Patrick Willems</title>
      <description>Our Sam Raimi series concludes with his most recent film - not to mention the first MCU film we’ve covered on the main feed - it’s time for Doctor Strange 2! Patrick Willems joins us to address the important questions: What was Raimi *doing* for the nine years between this and Oz? Does Kevin Feige and his Marvel Machine overpower Raimi’s creative voice? Should “Wandavision” have been released after this movie? Is Schnipper’s on 8th Ave the ideal place to debrief after seeing a movie in Times Square? Should America Chavez have been an adorable hobo riding the rails in between dimensions instead of a human MacGuffin? All that, plus Ben deploys his “nerd alert” buzzer instead of shoving the guys into a locker.

Patrick’s new film Night of the Coconut is available on Nebula (nebula.app/nightofthecoconut) or goto curiositystream.com/patrickhwillems and sign up for a discounted annual plan with free access to Nebula with your subscription. You can watch more of Patrick’s work on his YouTube channel.

      <title>Oz the Great and Powerful with Dana Schwartz</title>
      <description>Ah, yes - we’ve arrived at the reason why we held off on covering Sam Raimi for so long…because we didn’t want to end our series on such a dismal note! “Oz the Great and Powerful” - Raimi’s last feature until the recent “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” - features James Franco in a performance that guest Dana Schwartz (“Noble Blood”) characterizes as “having the energy of a hot boy in a school play who’s laughing with his friends in the front row.” It doesn’t have the tactile, zippy cinematic language of Raimi’s best work, instead opting for the popular hyper-saturated, entirely digital look of Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” (a clear influence). But it *does* have a little girl made of porcelain who almost made Ben cry. Topics discussed include our desire for a Mila Kunissance, Zach Braff being the surprise MVP in this movie, whether “Tinkers” are a specific ethnicity or a class or workers, and the Disney IP lawyers who had to be on set making sure nothing infringed on MGM’s copyright of the classic Oz visuals.

        <![CDATA[<p>Ah, yes - we’ve arrived at the reason why we held off on covering Sam Raimi for so long…because we didn’t want to end our series on such a dismal note! “Oz the Great and Powerful” - Raimi’s last feature until the recent “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” - features James Franco in a performance that guest Dana Schwartz (“Noble Blood”) characterizes as “having the energy of a hot boy in a school play who’s laughing with his friends in the front row.” It doesn’t have the tactile, zippy cinematic language of Raimi’s best work, instead opting for the popular hyper-saturated, entirely digital look of Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland” (a clear influence). But it *does* have a little girl made of porcelain who almost made Ben cry. Topics discussed include our desire for a Mila Kunissance, Zach Braff being the surprise MVP in this movie, whether “Tinkers” are a specific ethnicity or a class or workers, and the Disney IP lawyers who had to be on set making sure nothing infringed on MGM’s copyright of the classic Oz visuals.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>!</p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Drag Me to Hell with Jamie Loftus &amp; Caitlin Durante</title>
      <description>After the massive box office success of his Spider-Man movies, Sam Raimi went “back to basics” - returning to the gnarly demonic possession genre that he put his stamp on back in the “Evil Dead” days. This time, instead of the chin-god Bruce Campbell, we’ve got a particularly cherubic Alison Lohman in the starring role! The Bechdel Cast’s Caitlin Durante and Jamie Loftus join the #TwoFriends to chat about the goofy gross-out scares and economic recession relevance of 2009’s “Drag Me To Hell,” plus, we attempt to put together the ultimate canon of Goat Cinema.

      <title>Spider-Man 3 with Jamelle Bouie</title>
      <description>If “Spider-Man 2” had the reputation of being the greatest superhero movie of all time, “Spider-Man 3” had the inverse - a bloated mess with too many villains, and a very goofy Peter Parker going to the darkside, if by “darkside” you mean a trip to Men’s Warehouse and Hot Topic. But is that reputation justified? We’re gonna air on the side of…not REALLY. Notable Spidey 3 defender Jamelle Bouie (The New York Times, his podcast “Clear and Present Danger”) returns to Blank Check to praise this film’s focus on interpersonal relationships and quiet character moments. What else do we like? Griffin likes the “Editor’s Cut” (on Amazon Prime!). Ben *obviously* loves The Sandman. We all can agree that the much-memed sidewalk strut and jazz club sequences are a ton of fun. What doesn’t work? Let’s just say we have some issues with a lil guy named VENOM.

      <title>Spider-Man 2 with Chris Gethard</title>
      <description>For a while, “Spider-Man 2” was considered the high water mark for superhero movies - but does it hold up 14 years deep into the MCU? We’ve got two words for you - ALFRED MOLINA. Self-professed “Blank Check rabble rouser” Chris Gethard returns to the pod (and apologizes to the Blankie Community) as we trace the history and legacy of this iconic Spidey sequel. We love this movie so much, David doesn’t even care that the subway sequence isn’t accurate to New York! Other topics covered - why Aunt May should always be elderly and fragile, Tobey’s near-firing from the franchise, Mr Ditkovich Memes, our comic book villain rankings, and more!

      <title>Spider-Man with Matt Singer</title>
      <description>Upside down kissing, Bonesaw McGraw, and a soundtrack featuring not just one, but TWO of Avril Lavigne’s ex-husbands…it’s SPIDER-MAN! Screen Crush’s Matt Singer (who literally wrote a book about Spider-Man) joins us as we take a look back to a much different Hollywood landscape; a time when Marvel was a struggling comics company, when both Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire were considered odd choices for a superhero adaptation, and when no film had yet to open to $100M at the US Box Office. Is the hyphen in “Spider-Man” crucial to the film’s themes? Was it a mistake to cover Willem Dafoe’s already goblinesque visage with a mask? Does Joe Manganiello look too old to be a high school student? Join us as we discuss those questions and more!

      <title>The Gift with Starlee Kine</title>
      <description>Katie Holmes in a lazy southern accent asks, “What’s the matter? See somethin’ bad?” and we are immediately transported back to the year 2000 when the trailers for this movie were EVERYWHERE.  Writer and podcasting icon Starlee Kine joins us to talk about Sam Raimi’s “The Gift” - a film with an incredibly stacked cast of actors who were eager to sink their teeth into a Southern Gothic Billy Bob Thornton creation. Do we buy Keanu as a wife-beating redneck? Is Cate Blanchett actually a terrible psychic? How does Giovanni Ribisi’s performance in this rank among his most deranged screen outings? Folks - we apologize in advance for bringing up “The Other Sister”.

Folks - we apologize in advance for bringing up “The Other Sister”.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>!</p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>For Love of the Game with Olivia Craighead</title>
      <description>Is this not America? Is baseball not America’s favorite pastime? Is “For Love of the Game” a Sam Raimi movie? Technically speaking, sure! It’s about a guy who’s trying not to lose both his hand and his lady - some very Raimi-esque themes. Gawker’s Olivia Craighead returns to the pod to talk about Kevin “Straight Outta Compton” Costner, and we go long on crackerjacks, Vin Scully’s screenplay notes, and the cinematic pleasures of baseball. The crack of the bat, baby!
Plus - the boys open up about their little league days (Ben obviously loved to steal bases).

      <title>A Simple Plan with Kevin Smith</title>
      <description>$4.4 million, a murder of crows, and a cursed crashed plane…the ingredients for a real nail-biter of a fable! Filmmaker Kevin Smith (yep, THAT Kevin Smith) joins us to talk about one of his favorite films - 1998’s “A Simple Plan” - and to pay tribute to the late producer Jim Jacks, who shepherded several filmmakers (such as Raimi, the Coens, Richard Linklater, and Smith himself) as they made their transitions from scrappy indies to the big leagues. How successfully is Raimi able to meld his signature kinetic style with this film’s air of prestige? Was Billy Bob Thornton “the best actor alive between the years of 1998 and 2003,” per David? What would YOU do if you discovered all that money in the woods? Ben would buy an island, and there would be no problems or conflicts, and it would just be really chill and fun!

      <title>The Quick and The Dead with Roman Mars</title>
      <description>Considered a bit of a “blank check” for actress Sharon Stone (she used her clout to bring Sam Raimi, Russell Crowe, and a babyfaced Leonardo DiCaprio to the project), “The Quick and The Dead” may have been too quirky for mainstream audiences and too earnest for the post-Tarantino generation of cinephiles back in 1995. But boy, does it slap in 2022! Roman Mars - The golden-voiced host of “99% Invisible” - joins us as David offers his definitive Russell Crowe performance ranking, and as we finally get an excuse to go long on the screen persona of Gene Hackman.

      <title>Army of Darkness with Eva Anderson</title>
      <description>KLAATU BARADA NIKTO - did we get that right? Writer Eva Anderson (WeCrashed, You’re the Worst) joins us as we attempt to answer several questions related to the final entry in the Evil Dead trilogy - 1993’s Army of Darkness. Why was this film not called MEDIEVAL DEAD? Did Embeth Davidtz and Liam Neeson talk about Sam Raimi on the set of Schindler’s List? How does Ben feel about the concept of a town pit? And most importantly, we introduce a tantalizing Hollywood mystery - was there a falling out between Silver Lake roommates Sam Raimi, Joel &amp; Ethan Coen, Frances McDormand, Holly Hunter, and their sixth roommate…Kathy Bates?

      <title>Darkman with Chris Weitz</title>
      <description>Who’s Darkman? A man of a thousand faces! A walking fleshwound who probably smells awful! A dude who probably would be into night eggs! Filmmaker Chris Weitz joins us to geek out over Sam Raimi’s homage to the Universal Monsters - a film that establishes the comic book style that Raimi would later perfect with his “Spider-Man” trilogy. We discuss the early 90s run of pulpy comic book films (“Dick Tracy”, “The Shadow”), the shock of seeing Frances McDormand in what she describes as a “bimbo role,” and the unbelievably true story of how Sam Raimi swapped in his own cut of “Darkman” when the studio tried to release their own version.

      <title>Evil Dead II with John Hodgman</title>
      <description>It’s the definitive Sam Raimi film - a “symphony of silly” with a bravura performance from Bruce Campbell, and a prevailing sense of, “the more gore the merrier!” John Hodgman - who, believe it or not, was Bruce Campbell’s literary agent! - joins us to chat about the magic of “Evil Dead II” and what puts it in the pantheon of “sequels that improve upon the original installment.” Also in this episode - we imagine the time when Sam Raimi, the Coens, Frances McDormand, and Holly Hunter were all roommates in Silverlake; a behind the scenes look at the publication of Bruce Campbell’s best-selling memoir “If Chins Could Kill”; and an unrelated but very involved tangent about the Peanuts comic strip.

      <title>Crimewave with Brendan Hines</title>
      <description>Sam Raimi directed a movie between “The Evil Dead” and “Evil Dead II” that was written by the Coen Brothers and no one ever talks about it…until NOW! Actor Brendan Hines (“The Tick”, “Locke and Key”) joins us to make sense of this early career oddity - a tonal mishmash of slapstick and film noir that we’d later see more successfully executed in films like “Who Framed Roger Rabbit?” and “The Mask”. Topics discussed include: the difficulties in scaling up the indie production model; Bruce Campbell’s evolving star persona; whether or not you can actually wash dishes in lieu of paying for your meal; and more!

      <title>The Evil Dead</title>
      <description>It’s Sam Raimi time - groovy! Our new series PODCAST ME TO HELL kicks off with a banger - 1981’s ultra-low-budget horror classic “The Evil Dead”. We’ll be taking you back to Royal Oak, Michigan, to explain how Raimi linked up with Bruce Campbell and the Coen Brothers, thus establishing a very consequential partnership. We’ll be dissecting exactly why this film (from a lean 14-page script!!) works so well. David will admit that he first learned about this movie from watching “Donnie Darko”. And then all of a sudden…*CRASH*...a branch goes through the window! All that, plus TWO box office games!

      <title>The Power of The Dog with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>An unseen presence looming over the two friends, a man who has definitely ridden a dang horse, a larger than life character about whom many have speculated…are we talking about Bronco Hosley or Bronco Henry? Trolls impresario and Vanity Fair critic Richard Lawson makes his tenth (!!) appearance on the pod to unpack Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog.” Did Campion figure out the best use of Benedict Cumberbatch’s screen presence? Is anthrax the poison with the coolest name? Can you imagine Gerard Depardieu starring in this - it’s apparently his favorite book! All that, plus our final Campion rankings and the announcement of our next series.

      <title>Bright Star with Fran Hoepfner</title>
      <description>You may as well call this episode “Ode to a Whishaw” because we love that gentle gent! Fran Hoepfner joins us (and joins the Five-Timers Club!) to discuss Jane Campion’s 2006 John Keats biopic “Bright Star,” a movie that prompts Griffin to wonder if he, too, would die of tuberculosis if he took a long walk in the rain in 1820. Of course we talk about Hampstead Heath (David being canonically from London), of course we wonder what the hell happened to Paul Schneider (canonically incredible in this movie), and of course Ben is obsessed with Fanny Brawne’s epic Regency Era fits!

      <title>In the Cut with Jourdain Searles</title>
      <description>Want to hear us talk about how hot Mark Ruffalo is for two hours? Oooh boy, do we have a treat for you! Wikipedia-cited “In The Cut” stan Jourdain Searles joins us to unpack Jane Campion’s unjustly maligned erotic thriller. What happens to actresses once they turn 40? Would this movie have fared better with audiences if - instead of America’s Sweetheart Meg Ryan - it starred an edgier Nicole Kidman as originally planned? Do you remember the SCANDAL when Meg Ryan cheated on Dennis Quaid with Russell Crowe? Why did we care so much about that?

      <title>Holy Smoke! with Kyle Buchanan</title>
      <description>Is it nobler to try to pee on camera and fail than it is to not try at all? Does Harvey Keitel’s performance in this film only work when he puts on a dress? What the hell is going on in this movie?! David’s Fest Friend Forever Kyle Buchanan (author of the forthcoming “Blood, Sweat &amp; Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road”) joins us to answer those questions and more as we discuss Jane Campion’s bugnuts exploration of power dynamics - 1999’s “Holy Smoke!” Come for the Winslet career breakdown, stay for Kyle’s “amazeballs” anecdotes about Campion on the international festival circuit.

      <title>The Portrait of a Lady with Marie Bardi</title>
      <description>This lady might not be “on fire” but she IS wearing a 19 inch corset! Social media maven Marie Bardi joins the boys to dissect Campion’s tepidly received follow-up to “The Piano” - the emotionally claustrophobic 1996 Henry James adaptation “The Portrait of a Lady”. If “The Piano” gave Jane her Blank Check, this film is a big swing and (in our opinion) a slight miss. Topics discussed include: John Malkovich’s clothing line for the modern dandy; the unfortunate plastic surgery-shaming of actress Barbara Hershey; Viggo Mortsenson’s performance in “Green Book” (one of our favorite topics);  and, of course, the queen of AMC Theaters herself - Nicole Kidman.

      <title>The Piano with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <description>Just imagine…it’s 1993. Bill Clinton is in the White House, Seinfeld is on TV, and America has PIANO FEVER! Newly-minted member of the Five Timers Club Esther Zuckerman joins us to unpack Campion’s Oscar-Winning erotic drama (possibly the first prestige pic to feature mild butt play). We’re asking all the tough questions: is “The King’s Daughter” the new “Margaret”? Should Harvey Keitel play Wolverine? Did Sam Neill tell Anna Paquin that he was going to work with actual dinosaurs after their shoot? Does Mr. Skin have a film critic on staff? 
Check out Esther's new book Beyond the Best Dressed: A Cultural History of the Most Glamorous, Radical, and Scandalous Oscar Fashion

      <title>An Angel at My Table with Dana Stevens</title>
      <description>Dana Stevens (Slate.com / Her new Buster Keaton biography “Cameraman”) returns to the pod to *literally* wax poetic about the literary coming-of-age story “An Angel At My Table”. The film is an intimate, often heartbreaking saga of a woman discovering her own creative voice…and yes, the woman just happens to look like Little Orphan Annie. The gang discusses the film within the context of other films that show age progression through the casting of multiple actors; the context of films that depict mental illness; and the context of small redheaded children with very curly, almost spherical hair, who may or may not have hard knock lives. Plus - possibly our most obscure box office game yet, and some genuine Janet Frame poetry reading!

The gang discusses the film within the context of other films that show age progression through the casting of multiple actors; the context of films that depict mental illness; and the context of small redheaded children with very curly, almost spherical hair, who may or may not have hard knock lives. Plus - possibly our most obscure box office game yet, and some genuine Janet Frame poetry reading!

      <title>Sweetie with Sarah-Violet Bliss</title>
      <description>We’ve climbed up in our childhood treehouse and we’re not coming down! Sarah Violet Bliss (Search Party) joins us to talk about “Sweetie” - Jane Campion’s off-kilter meditation on suburbia and sibling rivalry. Revelations within the episode include the fact that David was part of the “Neighbours Society” at Uni (a group of students in favor of airing the Aussie soap in common areas twice daily); that one of the IMDB tags for this movie is “Rides A Man Like A Horse”; that Producer Ben has *definitely* known a few Sweetie-types in his life; and more!

      <title>Two Friends</title>
      <description>We’re kicking off our Jane Campion miniseries with her feature-length debut, auspiciously titled “Two Friends” - perhaps she has a competitive advantage? The backwards-structured script (the OG temporal pincer movement) leads the crew to reflect on their own adolescence…did you know David was already six feet tall at the age of twelve? And Ben was rocking size twelve shoes in middle school? Griffin may get a singular chest hair in 2022? Come for our Campion-filmography table setting, stay for a surprising amount of Simpsons discussion.

      <title>The Matrix Resurrections</title>
      <description>Happy New Year! We’re going back to the Matrix - which we last covered in 2016 (!!) - and we’re feeling pretty good about it! Seraph was a login screen, sure…but is “Tiffany” a .TIFF? Is Agent Smith just a virus? Are we taking crazy pills for liking this movie so much? Jack in and let’s fly, Blankies.
Opening clip is from Howl's Moving Castle with David Ehrlich

      <title>West Side Story (2021)</title>
      <description>They said it couldn’t be done. Remaking possibly the most revered movie musical of all time?! A fool’s errand! But folks, we’ve learned a very important lesson…NEVER DOUBT STEVEN SPIELBERG. Especially when he’s teaming up with Tony “Dank” Kushner! David pinpoints the exact moments he wept during his multiple viewings of this most recent iteration of “West Side Story”; Ben praises all the dust and hot people; Griffin thinks that he probably needs to see it again. Grab your dancing shoes and meet us at the gym - it’s our final episode of 2021, and it’s time to MAMBO, Blankies! 
Plus, check out the Slow Xmas 2021 holiday music compilation now on Spotify and Bandcamp! Please support the bands/artists featured on this album.

      <title>Benedetta with Marie Bardi</title>
      <description>Alert the horny police, because we’re taking ourselves to a nunnery with the Dirty Dutch Daddy himself - Paul Verhoeven! The gang goes bonkers for “Benedetta'', and Producer Ben-edetta reveals that he has an almost-saint in his family - one more miracle, and Ben gets to go to the Vatican! We discuss the connections between “Benedetta” and Verhoeven’s previous films (Sister Benedetta is a bit of a Catherine Trammell, and not just because she likes the ladies), do a smelly deep dive into the history of Professional Flatulists, and say a few prayers asking God to let Verhoeven make a big Hollywood movie again.

      <title>The Ward with Drew McWeeny</title>
      <description>We’ve spent four months in the Mouth of Madness with the Horror Master, and we’ve reached the end point of Carpenter’s directorial career...for now. A man who has *actually collaborated with John Carpenter* - Drew McWeeny (writer of Carpenter’s installments in the Masters of Horror series) - joins us to recontextualize our journey through Carpenter’s filmography with some exclusive behind-the-scenes tidbits. The Two Friends also discuss the strange career trajectory of Amber Heard (starting with the festival-smash-that-doesn’t-exist ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE), present their final Carpenter rankings, and reveal which Auteur they’ll cover on the podcast next. Plus - Ben learns the fun British term “video nasty” from David who grew up in England?

      <title>Ghosts of Mars with Dave Schilling &amp; Jonah Ray</title>
      <description>Contrary to popular belief (and Wikipedia), this film was NOT supposed to be another installment in the Snake Plissken series - John Carpenter just thought it would be cool to make a movie about Mars “because it’s red.” Galaxy Brain’s Dave Schilling and Jonah Ray join us to dissect Carpenter’s take on that dusty red planet, his obsession with crossfades, and his lackluster deployment of Pam Grier. Why *is* Mars a matriarchal society in this movie? We thought Mars needed moms…

      <title>John Carpenter’s Vampires with David Ehrlich</title>
      <description>They’re not just Vampires, they’re John Carpenter’s Vampires!  “Closer in patina” to a classic Howard Hawks western than anything Carpenter’s ever done, this film is nasty, gruesome, and devoid of any of the “teenyboppers” and romanticism that had become hallmarks of the slasher and vampire genres, respectively. David Ehrlich (Indiewire) joins us as we go deep into the woods - James Woods, that is - and come out with the least memorable Baldwin brother. Strada Chocolata!

      <description>Less of a sequel and more of a “next gen video game re-skin,” Snake Plissken is back in “Escape from LA” and this time he’s got a surfboard! The “Gourley and Rust” guys join us to ponder whether or not a big budget is actually *bad* for John Carpenter. On the one hand, we get a Carp, Kurt, and Debra Hill reunion! On the other…those submarine sequences.

      <title>Village of the Damned with Amy Nicholson</title>
      <description>It’s not “Children of the Damned” nor “Children of the Corn” nor “Corn of the Damned” - it’s John Carpenter’s “Village of the Damned,” goddamnit! Creepy blonde kids with laser eyes! Our guest Amy Nicholson’s (“Unspooled”) boyfriend thinks she looks like one of them. Griffin thinks David’s baby has “Village of the Damned” eyes, too. But is this movie actually scary enough? “Needs more menace!” per Ben. Topics covered include the Razzies, formative cinematic crushes, Christopher Reeve’s star persona, and a Chuck Norris movie that has him teaming up with a dog to take down an alliance of White Supremacist groups.

Topics covered include the Razzies, formative cinematic crushes, Christopher Reeve’s star persona, and a Chuck Norris movie that has him teaming up with a dog to take down an alliance of White Supremacist groups. </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>!</p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>In the Mouth of Madness with Angelica Jade Bastién</title>
      <description>Just in time for Halloween - it’s the conclusion of Carpenter’s “Apocalypse Trilogy” and one of the best Lovecraftian horrors ever to grace the silver screen! Vulture’s Angelica Jade Bastién joins us to chat “In the Mouth of Madness,” and we wonder - is Sam Neill a “dang ass freak”? Should this movie take place in a more “airport paperback” environment, like a beach town? What would you do if you saw the head of production at New Line getting…uh… “serviced” in public at an Oscar party? Grab your Sutter Cane book and listen up!

      <title>Memoirs of an Invisible Man with Alan Sepinwall</title>
      <description>In which we try to find the John Carpenter in what is overwhelmingly a Chevy Chase vanity project. The legendary Alan Sepinwall (Rolling Stone) joins us to make sense of this befuddling genre mishmash. What are the invisibility rules of this movie? Who is the silver-voiced British man named “Richard” and is that his real voice? Is Chevy Chase good at acting? Does it matter? In this movie…yeah, it kind of does! We’re sad to see the Carpenter hot streak end with this movie, but that’s what Blank Check is all about - the bounces, baby!

      <title>Starman with Katey Rich</title>
      <description>Voyager II may be approaching the “Termination Shock” (Ben’s new favorite phrase), but we’re on earth cherishing the otherworldly romance of John Carpenter’s STARMAN! Vanity Fair’s Katey Rich returns to discuss Jeff Bridges’ impressive performance, the illustrious career of Hollywood script doctor “Dinky” Dean Reisner, and the one sandwich that’s actually supposed to have paprika on it (whatever deviled egg thing Karen Allen orders at the diner in this movie).

      <description>It’s the Blank Check / Kingcast crossover event you’ve all been waiting for! Scott Wampler and Eric Vespe join us to discuss John Carpenter’s “Christine” - the first Stephen King adaptation we’ve covered. What is more terrifying - a sexy vintage car that kills people? Or Barbra Streisand’s basement mall? A difficult question, we know.

      <title>Escape from New York with Karen Han</title>
      <description>Grab your eyepatches - it’s Snake Plissken time! Karen Han joins the gang to chat Carpenter’s action classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK - which was actually filmed in St. Louis! Topics covered include NSFW tattoos, Lee Van Cleef’s badass gravestone, the 90s documentary where Ernest Borgnine just drives a bus, and John Carpenter’s rather pedestrian taste in video games. “Fallout 76”??? C’mon, John!

      <title>The Fog with Nia DaCosta</title>
      <description>A film brave enough to ask the question - what if there was fog? Just kidding - this movie is ACTUALLY about vengeful pirate ghosts and a lady with a sexy radio voice. CANDYMAN’s Nia DaCosta returns to the pod to ask whether or not fog is scary if you aren’t driving through it. Producer Ben wonders if the titular fog should have had a voice. Plus, we explore the history of spooky lighthouse movies.

      <title>Halloween with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>It’s our biggest episode EVER as Alex Ross Perry brings his own dossier of talking points to tackle 1978’s iconic HALLOWEEN. We explore the history of American independent cinema as seen through the lens of the low-budget horror genre, and determine who’d be included in the slasher villain Mount Rushmore (Chucky isn’t carved into the rock; he’d be working at the gift shop).

      <title>Dark Star with Emily Yoshida</title>
      <description>Our long-awaited John Carpenter series kicks off with his ultra-low budget oddity debut DARK STAR. Ben goes Hollywood (actually, “Hosleywood”) to record with Emily Yoshida - the Mother of Blankies herself - *in person* in Los Angeles, and the gang debates possible names for the series. We landed on “They Podcast” - which is a departure from Griffin’s far sweatier suggestions. Join us as we set the table for Carpenter’s filmography, and go deep on this film, which could also just be called “Space Dirtbags,” per Emily.

      <title>Old with Marie Bardi</title>
      <description>What if there was a beach that made you old? Only the mischievous mind of M. Night Shyamalan could conjure such a place! The gang (including Shyamalan Superfan and Blank Check social media manager Marie Bardi) dives into M. Night’s latest offering. Is it a “Glassterpiece”? Does Griffin even know what age he is anymore? Did Ben always have those wrinkles on his face?

      <title>Abduction with Jason Concepcion</title>
      <description>John Singleton’s filmography comes to an inauspicious end with “Abduction,” a film that tests the viability of “Taylor Lautner as Action Star.” Longtime friend of the pod Jason Concepcion (Crooked Media’s Takeline and ALL CAPS NBA) joins us as we mourn the untimely passing of Singleton and try to parse why this movie fails so spectacularly.

Special guest Ayo Edebiri (Big Mouth) returns to the pod with some crackling insights (and an inspired Shrek tangent) as we discuss the legacy of what some call Singleton’s stealth best film.

      <description>Blankie favorite Jamelle Bouie returns to the pod to discuss “Rosewood” - an ambitious historical epic whose failure at the box office (against not one, but TWO Star Wars re-releases) may have necessitated a shift for Singleton towards more commercial fare. The careers of Ving Rhames, Jon Voight, and Michael Rooker are spotlighted, as well as the surprising filmography of Rosewood’s screenwriter Greg Poirier.

      <title>Poetic Justice with Jourdain Searles</title>
      <description>Jourdain Searles (Bad Romance Pod) joins The Two Friends to discuss “Poetic Justice” - a film that is NOT about Janet Jackson teaching a poetry class, contrary to Griffin’s assumption. The episode also features a delightful Billy Zane tangent and includes probably the most Maya Angelou poetry of any Blank Check installment yet.

      <title>Boyz n the Hood with Aisha Harris</title>
      <description>Join us as we pour one out for John Singleton, the subject of our new miniseries - PODZ N THE CAST. Griffin and David welcome Aisha Harris (NPR’s Pop Culture Happy Hour) to chat about Singleton’s iconic debut feature, which saw him Oscar-nominated straight out of film school at the age of 24. Take that, Orson Welles. Griffin also lays out his “Cloverfield Monster” theory of movie-watching, and the boys discuss the reasons for Ice Cube’s success as a movie star (“great sneer!”)

      <description>He’s the kid from Third Rock. The Boy from Brick. The hitRECordjoe himself. Blank Check proudly presents a special one-film miniseries on the directorial career of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, so far consisting only of the baffling 2013 porn-addiction comedy DON JON. “The Boys” Sean Clements and Hayes Davenport of Hollywood Handbook join us as we ask the important questions, like, “Why does this movie not star Channing Tatum?” “How did he get ScarJo and Julianne Moore to do this?” “What is HitRecord?”

We conclude our Elaine May series with one of the biggest bounces in Hollywood history - the unfairly maligned Ishtar.

      <title>Moana with Lenika Cruz</title>
      <description>Griffin and David are finally doing it! They are CONSIDERING THE COCONUT! In addition to the coconut they also have an in-depth conversation about Musker and Clements’ final (and best?) film together, 2016's Moana. A departure from their typical 2D animation style, and a shift from Disney’s typical Princess / Prince structure, their first fully CG film delves into a Polynesian mythology AND makes everyone cry. 
They are joined this week by Lenika Cruz (The Atlantic) and discuss heavy topics like parental relationships and leaving home, as well as topics on the lighter side such as; what is the best use of The Rock, and will we be over Lin Manuel Miranda again this coming year.

      <title>The Walk with J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>In 1974 Philippe Petit performed his infamous walk between the Twin Towers. Director Robert Zemeckis many years later after discovering the story in a children's novel would create a 3D film based on this event. But most importantly in 2018, J.D. Amato appeared on Blank Check to discuss the motion picture technology of Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. Continuing in that tradition, J.D. returns for the third annual Talking the Walk. But this time instead of high frame rate, J.D. explores The Walk's cutting edge use of visual effects.

      <title>Beowulf with Jordan Hoffman</title>
      <description>This is Beowulf! Yes, in 2007, Bobby Z took the Old English epic poem and, once again using cutting edge mo-cap technology, delivered a 3-D movie that this week's guest, Jordan Hoffman, aptly describes as "resembling a PlayStation 3 cut scene". Also discussed is Crispin Glover's performance as Grendel, Angelina Jolie's hatred for this film, the background behind the Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary screenplay, and the PG-13 rating despite all the violence and horniness.

Check out Jordan's new podcast, The Dune Conversations with John and Jordan, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your pods!

Katey Rich returns as we reminisce Bruce Willis putting effort in, irritating European monologues, the thrilling billing and why Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn make a perfect cult pair.

      <title>Back to the Future Part III with Josh Gondelman</title>
      <description>In Back to the Future, Marty ends up in 1955, the same age as his parents. In the sequel he has to jump between that timeline and a bizarre 2015. The natural conclusion to this blockbuster trilogy? A wild western! It's a classic formula! For Back to the Future Part III, we're talking ninja turtles, the magic of Tom Wilson and Mary Steenburgen, and why ZZ Top should be in more movies. The bad boy of the internet himself, Josh Gondelman, (Desus and Mero, Make My Day) joins!

      <title>Back to the Future Part II with Nicole Byer</title>
      <description>Man wouldn't it be weird to have a future controlled by a rich blond bully who hates women, steals things and is awful to everyone? Robert Zemeckis predicts a wild, kooky, and somewhat accurate 2015 with Back to the Future Part II. Comedian Nicole Byer (Nailed It, Newcomers, Why Won't You Date Me) helps us make sense of the different timelines, unpack the connection to Trump, analyze the film’s strategic approach to the sequel and the ultimate disappointment that hoverboards continue to not exist.

      <title>Who Framed Roger Rabbit with Mike Mitchell &amp; Nick Wiger</title>
      <description>A noir for kids. Disney and Warner Bros characters together for the first and last time. Live action drama with kooky Tex Avery-style animation. There's really no movie quite like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. How long did "bumping the lamp" take? What's a contemporary take on Jessica and Roger Rabbit's relationship dynamics? How does the film's story mirror Hollywood? We invited the Doughboys themselves, Mike Mitchell and Nick Wiger to help us find out!

      <title>Back to the Future</title>
      <description>It was the #1 film of 1985. It’s a theme park ride. An animated series. It spawned video games. Comic books. Musicals. It’s in the goddamn Library of Congress! And key to this series, it guaranteed Robert Zemeckis big crazy budgets for decades. Has there ever been a bigger “blank check" than Back to the Future? Now make like a tree and start the episode already!

      <title>Romancing the Stone with Adam Kempenaar &amp; Josh Larsen</title>
      <description>How did Robert Zemeckis go from commercial flops to a career-defining time-travelling trilogy of blank checks? It’s all thanks to his “guarantor” from 1984 - Romancing The Stone, starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. We invited Filmspotting’s Adam Kempenaar and Josh Larsen to dive into Zemeckis’ first commercial success and how it set the tone for a decade of hits.

      <title>I Wanna Hold Your Hand with Patrick Willems</title>
      <description>Your March Madness winner series has arrived! Chosen by the listeners, our latest subject is Robert Zemeckis, a Hollywood hitmaker who gives us plenty to cover. But before we get to Forrest Gump and Back To The Future, we're starting with 1978's I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which centers on a group of girls sneaking into the Beatles games Ed Sullivan show performance.

Patrick Willems (@patrickhwillems) helps us kick it all off as we talk iconic dork performances, the best Beatles movies, and the confidence in this directorial debut.

      <title>The Old Guard </title>
      <description>In The Old Guard (2020), Charlize Theron, Kiki Layne, and a group of immortal warriors define why it's worth living to fight another day. Plus they look extremely cool doing it. This week, we wrap up Gina Prince-Bythewood's series with her most recent film, released on Netflix mid-pandemic. How has 2020 affected the release and how we watch it (preferably from a porch)? What do we want to see out of a sequel? What's the best Netflix movie formula? Join Griffin, David and Ben as we list our favorite Prince-Blythwood movies and what blank checks we're looking forward to in the future.

      <title>Love &amp; Basketball with Carl Tart</title>
      <description>It’s rare we get to start a mini-series with a classic. 20 years after its release, Gina Prince-Bythewood’s directorial debut still stands the test of time as a top-tier cinematic love story. This week’s all about Love and Basketball (2000), which would set the tone for her career. But what’s the story that led her there? Carl Tart (The Good Place, Comedy Bang Bang) joins as we discuss how Sanaa Lathan fought for her big break, the impact of seeing a romance between two Black leads on the big screen (and VHS), and confuse Griffin with WNBA and NBA stats.

      <title>Mixed Nuts with Charles Rogers </title>
      <description>The friends are joined by Search Party director Charles Rogers to discuss this mixed bag of mixed messages of a Christmas movie that shows maybe Norah Ephron can't do black comedies. Don't worry if you haven't seen it, because this is mostly an extensive discussion about Steve Martin's career, Liev Schreiber being great in drag, and the Sondheim musical Assassins. 

Check out Search Party Season 3 on HBO Max, RIGHT NOW! 

For the month of June we will be spotlighting groups dedicated to and run by Black trans and non-binary people who need our help.
This week's organization is: The Marsha P. Johnson Institute marshap.org/donate/ twitter.com/MPJInstitute

      <title>Sleepless in Seattle with Katey Rich</title>
      <description>Only Nora Ephron could make a rom-com where the leads interact for 2 minutes an instant classic. The BC crew makes a Tom and Meg inspired long distance call to Katey Rich (Vanity Fair) for Ephron's sophomore hit, Sleepless in Seattle (1993). We get into how rom-coms have risen and fallen, the lure of cool boat houses, and the enigma that is Chet Hanks. 
For the month of June we will be spotlighting groups dedicated to and run by Black trans and non-binary people who need our help.

      <title>When Harry Met Sally... with Dana Stevens</title>
      <description>It laid the groundwork for her entire film career. It set the mold for every rom-com that followed. Though it wasn’t her directorial debut, you just don’t do Nora Ephron without covering When Harry Met Sally. We invited Slate critic and podcast host Dana Stevens (Culture Gabfest, Flashback) to discuss the 1989 classic and ask the big questions. How is Billy Crystal so damn charming? Which Meg Ryan hairstyle is best? And most importantly...can men and women be friends???

      <title>Lorenzo's Oil with Bilge Ebiri</title>
      <description>Hard to believe we're already halfway through our George Miller series! This week Bilge Ebiri (Vulture) returns to talk about one of his favorite films, 1992's Lorenzo's Oil. Starring Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte...with an Italian accent that somehow works...Oil may have disappointed at the box office but still got a screenplay and best actress Oscar nomination. Turns out medical dramas really work when they're made by actual doctors...who happen to be as talented as George Miller.

      <description>Who? Weekly hosts Bobby Finger and Lindsey Weber talk about Demme's last film, written by Diablo Cody. But they really just want to talk about Tully. It's a film about dead beat [get it? BEAT??] Moms with Meryl's real daughter, and Griffin is so laid back he has his microphone in his lap. What works for Wild Rose that doesn't work for this film? Can we talk about her INSANE TATTOO FOR A SECOND? And what's the best place to watch this movie?

      <title>A Master Builder with John Hodgman</title>
      <description>David, Griffin, and self-made man of letters John Hodgman have to deal with Ragnar in this weird weird weird adaptation of a Henrik Ibsen play - and by adaptation, we mean they just took the play and filmed it in a house in Nyack. But instead of talking about the not so great film, get ready for more rants about Cars 2 (WHAT IS MONEY HOW DOES THIS WORK?) and the explanation of how Playmobil the Movie happened without anyone noticing. Also, in no way was this episode accidentally deleted and hastily re-recorded at the last minute.

      <title>The Manchurian Candidate with the Flop House: Dan McCoy, Stuart Wellington, and Elliott Kalan</title>
      <description>The Flop House joins Blank Check to talk about this remake that was like okay, but definitely better than the last Demme remake. Is Meryl good or weird? Why is a pack of cards so sexy? How many films and TV shows are there about last men? How do you get rid of ants? What mysteries are still left unanswered? And what does the Flop House think about Trolls the Experience?

      <title>Birds of Prey with Ang Ferraguto, Emma Stefansky, Ashleigh Heaton, and Preeti Chhibber</title>
      <description>No boys allowed, although gender is a construct. It's an all-women special! Ang Ferraguto is joined by Emma Stefansky, Ashleigh Heaton, and Preeti Chhibber. This PodSkwad is NOT here to complain about Star Wars, but to talk about this women-powered DC movie full of hammers and hair ties, fun guns and fun outfits, and women helping women by kicking ass. How can you tell this was made by a woman? And which psychopaths are Griffin and David? #Let men have nipples.

      <description>Director and filmmaker David Lowery joins the two friends to talk about a weird remake of an Audrey Hepburn movie, except bad, starring Mark Wahlberg in his self-described worst role. There are insane hat choices and a very long ballroom scene. What was the last video game that Lowery played? Why is Tom Cruise wearing Ugg boot? How does Ted Levine die?  And what film did Lowry review and later realize he hadn't actually seen? THIS MOVIE HONKS!

What shows should get gritty reboots? Why did concert films stop existing?  What is the song Heaven about (what isn't it about?) Have you seen DJ Khaled's Slack channel? And what would David Byrne sound like ordering a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese? One of the great things is that there's no talking heads about the Talking Heads, it's just a great show.

      <description>What in the world is going on with this film that has two versions - of which the good one is not available anywhere? What is the titular "Shift" actually referring to? What happens when two stars  - gasp - fall in love? And why are Griff and Dave so off their game in a strange new studio? Find out all this and more in this episode of DEMME CONFESSIONALS.

      <title>Melvin and Howard (and Jordan Hoffman)</title>
      <description>Finally, we get to the good Demme movies with film critic Jordan Hoffman. The partially true story of a guy who thinks Howard Hughes is gonna leave him money. What made Griffin almost cry (and not in frustration)? What is an animated movie actually and is it for children? What game shows attracted the weirdest contestants. Why isn't there a good movie where someone's telling someone to go get their shine box? And what's your favorite Airplane joke?

      <title>Citizens Band/ Last Embrace with Justin McElroy </title>
      <description>Guest Justin McElroy is gonna be mad he volunteered to do any film when Griff and David talk about Demme's first two tries at "real" movies after his Roger Korman saga. The trio talk about CB, or "Citizen's Band," and Last Embrace, a surprisingly Judaic Thriller. The films contain oddly touching birthday party scenes, IMDB spoilers,  children named Blood, and the introduction of heavy concepts that are never dealt with. Did Ben Kingsley win an Oscar?  What's Justin's 30-second Tim Robbins story? Also what is Mandy Patinkin, the Patinkiest, doing in this movie?

      <title>Caged Heat/ Crazy Mama/ Fighting Mad</title>
      <description>It’s the first episode of a new mini-series. You voted for him, you’ve only yourself to blame for JONATHAN DEMME. Probably one of the directors with the most range of films - from rom coms to serious dramas - Griffin and David start with the first three of his films, each a strange genre movie: Caged Heat about a prison break; Crazy Mama about women doing crimes; and Fighting Mad which pits farmers vs coal companies. What is the appeal of women’s prison movies? Literally what is Michael Richards doing all day? Can art be non-political nowadays? And what exactly makes Demme SO iconic that he’s such an influencer?

Starting us of is the 1981 jewel stealing neo-noir, Thief. But were there literal wanted criminals on the set of this movie? Is James Cann the best at Twitter? What is Mann's top 10 Sight &amp; Sound and is there a strange contemporary outlier? Together Griffin and David examine Michael Mann's background, the performances of Cann, Robert Prosky and Willie Nelson and spend some time on Dennis Farina's mustache.

      <title>Big Eyes with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>Richard Lawson returns to discuss the late-Burton effort: 2014's Big Eyes. But why are the eyes so big? Should Christoph Waltz be the star of his own network TV sitcom? How did Burton pull off making the focus of this movie about the main character's abuser? Together they examine the eyes (which are big), Margaret Keane's history and Alita: Battle Angel (which is also known as Big Eyes 2.) 

Plus, check out past (and future) guests Richard and Joanna Robinson's podcast Still Watching: Game of Thrones.

      <itunes:summary>Richard Lawson returns to discuss the late-Burton effort: 2014's Big Eyes. But why are the eyes so big? Should Christoph Waltz be the star of his own network TV sitcom? How did Burton pull off making the focus of this movie about the main character's abuser? Together they examine the eyes (which are big), Margaret Keane's history and Alita: Battle Angel (which is also known as Big Eyes 2.) 

Plus, check out past (and future) guests Richard and Joanna Robinson's podcast Still Watching: Game of Thrones.

      <title>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street with Michael Cerveris</title>
      <description>Tony award winning actor, Michael Cerveris, joins Griffin and David to discuss 2007's film adaption of the renowned Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Why did Tim Burton cut The Ballad of Sweeney Todd? Does Michael have a take on National Treasure: Book of Secrets? Timothy Spall goes big? Together they examine how the film holds up against the live production, the trailer lacking singing, letter writing with Sondheim and Michael's experience portraying Sweeney Todd in the 2005 Broadway revival. 

And check out Michael Cerveris' band, Loose Cattle!

      <description>Chris Gethard Beautiful/Anonymous podcast returns to Blank Check to discuss 2003's father and son fantasy, Big Fish. And also, to talk about Star Wars some more. But does Big Fish's ending pay out like a slot machine? Was 2003 the year Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton culturally flip-flopped? What are some of the nerd perks offered at the new Star Wars hotels? Together, they spend 2+ hours examining the performances of the cast including Albert Finney and Billy Crudup, motorcycle cages, which vignette to cut out of this movie, and of course Mr. Soggybottom. 

Plus, be sure to grab copy of Chris Gethard's new book, Lose Well!

      <title>Mars Attacks! with Paul F. Tompkins</title>
      <description>Blank Check continues its mini-series covering the films of director Tim Burton with the alien invasion comedy, Mars Attacks! But what are the origins of development for this 1960's trading card IP? How does this movie compare to Independence Day 20 years later? Does David have a half-sister, and if so, why has she never been mentioned before? Joined by comedian, Paul F. Tompkins (BoJack Horsman), they discuss the various performances of this stacked ensemble cast, the unusual billing, face goop, Entourage the movie and extreme Burton stereotypes such as happy suburban people and haunted ghost children. 

And be sure to check out Paul at Vancouver's Just for Laughs Festival Sunday, February 17th with 'Mr. Jackson &amp; Mr. Tompkins: A Two-Gentleman Improv Show'!

      <title>Glass</title>
      <description>On the week of it’s release in January of 2019, Griffin and David discussed M. Night Shyamalan’s latest offering, Glass. But did the hosts find this film to be a “glassterpiece”? What is Papa executive privilege time? If you had to guess what would you say Samuel L. Jackson’s age would be? Together they try to make sense of why M. Night wanted to tell this particular story, recent Bruce Willis straight to Redbox movies and get retrospective on their two hundredth episode! Plus, a special supercut of Blankies reading Producer Ben’s many, many nicknames.

      <title>The Holiday with Fran Hoepfner</title>
      <description>Writer, Fran Hoepfner joins Griffin and David to discuss 2006’s house swap rom-com, The Holiday. But Is foreplay really overrated? Was John Krasinski in The Holiday the Adam Driver of Lincoln of 2006? Is Garden State the most iconic New Jersey movie because they go to Medieval Times and yell at a ditch? Together, they examine the careers of Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jack Black and Jude “Daddy” Law; Christmas in England; loving movie scores enough to make gibberish sounds in public places and Venom being SO rude. Plus, another Romilly’s Kitchen Corner, the classic segment ‘Checking in with Fran’ and ALOT of Eli Wallach talk.

Plus, another Romilly’s Kitchen Corner, the classic segment ‘Checking in with Fran’ and ALOT of Eli Wallach talk. </p><p>Music selections:</p><p>“Family Tree” by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Jahzzar/">Jahzzar</a></p><p>“Weather Scanning” by <a href="http://ailanthusrecordings.bandcamp.com">Lindsheaven Virtual Plaza</a></p><p>Licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons: Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a>.</p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a>. </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk with J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>Blank it, thank it! J.D. Amato (The President Show) returns, in the last episode of our mini series devoted to the filmography of director Ang Lee, to discuss 2016’s high frame rate Iraq War drama, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. But what makes this movie so revolutionary? What is the evolution of frame rates in film? Who are the shortest and the tallest actors according to IMDB? Together they examine the history of cameras from film to digital, the BIG3 basketball league and never doing an episode on The Happytime Murders. 
For your very own “I Talked the Walk 2018” merch go to TeePublic! 
On Thursday, look out for our bonus episode on the Ang Lee directed short film “Chosen” part of the BMW film series The Hire and then next week will begin our new mini series on the films of Nancy Meyers!

      <title>Hulk</title>
      <description>This week is all about 2003’s Hulk. The origins of this project. How Ang Lee played the Hulk on set. Our hosts favorite film genre: the bad dad Nick Nolte. The juxtaposition of serious and comic books in the filmmaking. How the hulk hands kid’s toy comes from a somber, meditative family drama about the way our fathers damage us. And the careers of Jennifer Connelly and Eric Bana. Music courtesy of "Night Court Theme" by Jack Elliott

      <title>The Iron Giant</title>
      <description>This week Blank Check begins a new mini series reviewing the filmography of director Brad Bird with a discussion of 1999’s critically acclaimed animated feature, The Iron Giant. But does the Iron Giant wear a shirt? Did the studio request this movie be set in present day and have a hip hop soundtrack? Should Griffin and David fight more? Together, in their worst episode ever, they examine Brad Bird’s origin story, the hotness of Harry Connick Jr. as beatnik industrial artist Dean McCoppin, the upcoming Blank Check Pictures slate and booger stores.

      <title>How Do You Know</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/6831680</link>
      <description>In the final episode of our mini series devoted to the filmography of James L. Brooks, Griffin and David discuss the disastrous 2010 film How Do You Know. But why would Brooks at this moment in history sympathize with the business executives being held accountable for their corporate malfeasance? What does it mean when referring to a scene as a steam room? And also how do you know? Together they examine the careers of Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson, the Australian word for ‘grogan,’ and the 120 million dollar budget. This episode is sponsored by WeTransfer and Light Stream (lightstream.com/blank).

      <title>Spanglish with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>Richard Lawson (author of All We Can Do Is Wait) returns to discuss 2004’s Spanglish. But is this movie really about James L. Brooks attempting to justify why he wants to sleep with his maid? Is it believable a character has never seen a man cry? Is this film available on blu-ray and will it’s value increase over time like bitcoins? Together they examine Adam Sandler’s career, Téa Leoni’s VERY big performance, using monologues from Spanglish for auditioning and birthdays at a themed restaurant called Mars 2112.

      <description>Chris Gethard (the Chris Gethard Show on TruTV, Beautiful/Anonymous podcast) joins Griffin and David to discuss 1997’s OCD dramedy, As Good as It Gets. But is the dog the fourth lead of this film? Should the term ‘residuals’ be changed to ‘Ratzenbergers?’ Could a painter really afford to live in downtown Manhattan in the late 1990s? Together they examine the “but I like her” genre of movies, the careers of Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Nien Nunb and more!

      <title>I’ll Do Anything: The Musical Cut with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/6796023</link>
      <description>James L. Brooks had originally shot I’ll Do Anything as a musical. But in the test screening it was so disastrous the studio insisted he cut all the musical sequences out and reshoot new scenes to fill it in. Having reviewed that theatrical cut, Griffin and David revisit this film with returning guest Esther Zuckerman and discuss the lost, coveted musical cut of I’ll Do Anything in a special bonus episode. But what would the child of Albert Brooks and Julie Kavner sound like? Why does Griffin insist on singing the horrid song “You Are The Best?” Is this episode haunted? Together they go through all the musical numbers and try to decide if this version of the movie makes it any less worse.

      <title>I'll Do Anything with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <description>Writer and friend of the show Esther Zuckerman joins Griffin and David to discuss 1994’s I'll Do Anything. But was this film originally developed and shot as a musical only to be reedited into a mostly non-musical?

Together they examine the inside baseball dealings of Hollywood, the bad 90’s fashion, honest curses and comedic frontal nudity.

      <title>Running Scared with Paul Scheer</title>
      <description>This week is with special guest Paul Scheer (How Did This Get Made? podcast) who picked a favorite film from his youth: 1986’s underrated buddy cop movie Running Scared. But should more films have an extended middle act where the main characters just go on vacation? Where does this Joey Pants fall in the pantheon of Pants? How weirdly hot is Billy Crystal in this film? Together they discuss Dan Hedaya’s back and chest hair, Director Peter Hyams’ relationship with his actors and Paul’s passion for this film!

      <title>Elle with Emily Yoshida</title>
      <description>In the final installment of our ‘Paul Verhoeven in Hollywood’ mini series, Emily Yoshida (Night Call Podcast) returns for a special bonus episode on 2016’s pitch black French dramedy, Elle. But what other actresses were considered for the lead role even though Isabelle Huppert is clearly the perfect casting choice? Is this a successful satire of French erotic thrillers according to Griffin’s Mom? Can the video game being designed in the movie be at all entertaining? Together they discuss a connection to 90’s sitcom Friends, the goofy male characters, French sighing and present their Verhoeven filmography rankings.

      <title>Hollow Man with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>Writer/director Alex Ross Perry (Nostalgia, Golden Exits) returns to Blank Check to discuss 2000’s invisible sci-fi slasher, Hollow Man. But why is this not your grandfather’s invisible man movie? What was the running Joey Slotnick bit on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn? Does this film lack the satire and point of view of Verhoven’s past movies? Together they discuss the career trajectory of Kevin Bacon, poorly executed Tarantino-esque schoolyard jokes, the original Dark Universe of the 1990s and why this film’s poor reception caused Verhoeven to retreat back to the Netherlands.

      <title>Showgirls with Caroline Framke</title>
      <description>Caroline Framke (Vox) joins Griffin and David to discuss 1995’s iconic erotic drama Showgirls. But was screenwriter Eszterhas’ original pitch scribbled on a cocktail napkin? Is this film a parable for Hollywood? Where is the character Nomi from? Together they examine Caroline’s experience seeing this movie for the first time at a screening in a Hollywood cemetery with Elizabeth Berkley, really aggressive dry humping and different places!

        <![CDATA[<p>Caroline Framke (Vox) joins Griffin and David to discuss 1995’s iconic erotic drama Showgirls. But was screenwriter Eszterhas’ original pitch scribbled on a cocktail napkin? Is this film a parable for Hollywood? Where is the character Nomi from? Together they examine Caroline’s experience seeing this movie for the first time at a screening in a Hollywood cemetery with Elizabeth Berkley, really aggressive dry humping and different places! </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a>.</p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a>. </p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Total Recall with Andrew Jupin and Stephen Sajdak</title>
      <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is Andrew Jupin and Stephen Sajdak, 2 of the 4 co-hosts of the We Hate Movies podcast. Together they discuss 1990’s twisted sci-fi thriller, Total Recall. But how much creative control did Arnold have over this film? What is Michael Ironside actual first name? Are all the Johnny cabs designed so that if a passenger skips on the fare the robot driver’s head explodes? Their conversation includes peak practical effects, Robert Costanzo playing himself in the film and if the story that unfolds is in fact all just a dream.

      <title>RoboCop</title>
      <description>Griffin and David discuss dystopian action satire, 1987’s RoboCop. But is old Detroit a cancer and the cancer is crime? Was this film a deconstruction of the American hero mythology? Is it true that Verhoeven initially read half a page of the script and threw in the trash only to have his wife retrieve it and encourage him to give it a second chance? Together they examine the construction and evolution of the RoboCop costume, breaking squib records, 1987’s Academy award winners and many other tangents.

      <title>Flesh+Blood</title>
      <description>This week’s episode begins a new mini series (Podship Casters) covering the Hollywood films of director Paul Verhoeven. Already an accomplished filmmaker in the Netherlands, 1985 marked his American debut with the unpleasantly realistic period piece, Flesh+Blood. But how gross was the medieval times? What was the influence of growing up under Nazi occupation on Verhoeven’s worldview? Is it intended for the viewer to root for the plague? Together, Griffin and David discuss his original Dutch movies, Bosch paintings, and how Flesh+Blood’s failure at the box office would inform his study of American culture and his future films.

      <title>The Post</title>
      <description>In November of 2017, Griffin and David attended the first screening of Nixon era political thriller, The Post. But did it really only take 9 months to make this film after Spielberg first read the script? Was there intention to make a movie about the freedom of the press in our current political climate? Is this an Oscar candidate for Best Picture? Together they discuss our two greatest living actors Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, Mr. Show’s Bob &amp; David reuniting, broth and go on the record with their predictions for the 89th Academy Awards.

      <title>Talking Maul Live @ DCM19 with Peter Serafinowicz</title>
      <description>Live from the 19th annual Del Close Marathon in New York City, Peter Serafinowicz (The Tick) joins Griffin and David for a serious conversation about Peter’s role as the voice of Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. This special episode marks a return to the podcast’s early days as exclusively a Star Wars prequels podcast. But what was Peter’s approach to prepare for 4 lines of voice over dialogue? Why weren’t there any songs in the Phantom Menace? Is it Producer Ben’s birthday? Together they discuss wrestling George Lucas, Peter’s upcoming autobiography Maul &amp; Me, the film’s lack of ghosts and answer the Proust Questionnaire. Plus, be sure to watch the debut of the Tick August 25th on Amazon Prime Video!

      <title>The Dark Knight Rises</title>
      <description>Griffin and David complete Nolan’s Batman Trilogy with a discussion of 2012’s The Dark Knight Rises. But is it true the director’s brother and frequent collaborator, Jonathan Nolan, presented Christopher with a 400 page script? Were there any other rumors not about Killer Croc? Have we started the fire? Together they examine the different Catwoman performances, Nolan’s Howard Hughes script getting Scor-cheesed, the squints of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the Mooch and agree that crime should stay illegal.

      <title>Insomnia with Alex Ross Perry</title>
      <description>Writer and director, Alex Ross Perry (Golden Exits), joins Griffin and David to discuss 2002’s psychological thriller remake, Insomnia. But does this movie fit into the tradition of the auteur’s bizarre third feature? What has changed about Al Pacino’s acting post-Oscar win? How is this film another example of Nolan playing with noir conventions? Together, they discuss Robin Williams’ 2002, Hilary Swank’s career trajectory, how Darren Aronofsky came the closet to taking on Batman before Nolan did and why it’s implausible the Alaskan police chief played by Paul Dooley would also conveniently be a former LAPD detective.

      <title>Following</title>
      <description>In the first episode of a new mini series focusing on the filmography of Christopher Nolan, Griffin and David discuss the 1998 debut feature, Following. But how have conmen or “confidence men” influenced the director’s later work? How was the burgeoning filmmaker received by festivals? Is the uncensored director’s cut of Nutty Professor II: The Klumps worth viewing? Together they examine the extended Nolan family, Kevin Bacon getting Bernie Madoff’d, Griffin’s auteur video rental store and David’s recent dance moves. Also, BRAAAMS.

      <title>Bridge of Spies</title>
      <description>Griffin and David this week gush over 2015’s Cold War drama, Bridge of Spies. But how does this film fall into Tom Hanks’ beginning a new phase in his career? What is the standing man? What was the Coen Brothers’ involvement in the screenplay? Together they passionately discuss Mark Rylance’s Academy Award winning performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel, Hanks’ mastering of being a good man and having the sniffles, and solidify a new shorthand for describing Spielberg’s filmmaking that involves a spice rack.

      <title>Lincoln</title>
      <description>Griffin and David look to Spielberg’s 2012 historical drama, Lincoln. But exactly how many Abraham Lincoln biographies did screenwriter Tony Kushner read? Does this movie remind one of a long winded story about an old mill? Was Liam Neeson really considered for the lead role? Together they examine the great facial hair, Hal Holbrook’s wet eyes, Dan Lewis’ process for getting into character and the many blankets used in this movie.

      <title>The Adventures of Tintin with Joe Garden</title>
      <description>Joe Garden (The Onion) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss the mo-cap animated action/mystery, The Adventures of Tintin. But what was Peter Jackson’s involvement in the project? How is the character Tintin like a fine sparkling wine? Is Will &amp; Grace really coming back? Together, they compare the film to the original children book series by Hergé, examine the lessons children were taught in the 1930’s, again revisit Mystery Men and also suggest what actor would make a good Professor Calculus for any future sequels.

Together, they compare the film to the original children book series by Hergé, examine the lessons children were taught in the 1930’s, again revisit Mystery Men and also suggest what actor would make a good Professor Calculus for any future sequels.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>David Ehrlich (IndieWire) returns to Blank Check to discuss 2008's polarized franchise reboot, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. But are the rumors true that there is a superior early version of this screenplay? Is George Lucas to blame for the most of the criticism? And is it clear that Mutt Williams is a greaser type character? Together they examine, the new old Harrison Ford movies slated for release, the culture around the death of celebrities, the many follies of Shia LaBeouf and also explore Ray Winstone impressions.

      <description>Emily St. James (Vox) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss 2005’s Israeli espionage thriller, Munich. But is this movie’s lasting legacy being a reference in Knocked Up? What does it mean when Jeffrey Wells leaves behind his hat? What was with those sex scenes? Together, they go on the record with Oscar picks, examine Eric Bana’s career trajectory, ponder when Spielberg lost his virginity and go off on a tangent about the film Crash.

      <description>J.D. Amato (My Brother, My Brother and Me) makes his third appearance on Blank Check, this week discussing 2005’s sci-fi doomsday The War of the Worlds. Why would this film mark the conclusion of the Cruise and Spielberg partnership? How much of tangent does Griffin go off on while discussing McG? Are we to be convinced Tom Cruise is a blue collar guy? Together, Griffin, David and J.D. delve into Dakota Fannings’ preciousness, the movie Mystery Men, the history of the actress who jumped onto the villain and with their legs snaps his neck and more. Plus, J.D. reaches out from the future and Producer Ben records ADR.

      <description>This week’s guest, Jerah Milligan (Comedy Central), finally completes our trifecta of co-hosts from the excellent podcast Blank Men Can’t Jump In Hollywood joining Blank Check. The topic of discussion: 2004’s stranded at the airport dramedy The Terminal. But exactly how much Stanley Tucci does a movie need? What was behind the absurd Michael Douglas cancer story? Is it clear where exactly is Krakozhia? Together, Griffin, David and Jerah examine Catherine Zeta-Jones’ career trajectory, jazz photos, Shrek 3, saltine cracker sandwiches and more. Plus, Jerah shares a personal account of being trapped in the airport and Producer Ben is hungover AF.

      <title>Amistad</title>
      <description>Griffin and David look to Spielberg’s next film (also released in 1997) Amistad. But what are the glaringly problematic issues with this movie? Could a more suited director and screen writer have been brought onto the production? How long has Sir Anthony Hopkins been phoning it in exactly? Together they examine the career trajectory of Matthew McConaughey, Peter Firth receives comedy points and assess the cast in a performance review.

      <title>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</title>
      <description>The debut of our new mini series on the filmography of Steven Spielberg begins with 1997’s Lost World: Jurassic Park. Post-Oscar wins for Best Director and Best Picture, Steven took four years off before directing this sequel. In that time he founded his own studio DreamWorks. Griffin and David would argue this level of creative control is the biggest blank check that any filmmaker has ever had. Presenting Pod Me If You Cast.
But seriously what IS chaos math? Why does this film unfold similarly to a video game? What does Isla Nublar roughly translate to?
Together #thetwofriends discuss the careers of Laura Dern, Vince Vaughn, Jeff Goldblum, convenient islands, life finding a way and a epic Pete Postlethwaite monologue.

      <title>Aliens of the Deep/Ghosts of the Abyss</title>
      <description>Griffin and David this week discussed two documentaries directed by James Cameron: 2003’s Ghost of the Abyss and 2006’s Aliens of the Deep. But what were the early days of IMAX like? What kind of very rich person loves risking their lives in a submarine? Does David or Producer Ben rep Jupiter's moon, Europa, harder? Together, they examine Bill Paxton’s Texas accent, water drones James &amp; Elwood and play a double dose of the box office game.

      <title>Titanic with Emily Yoshida and Katey Rich - Part Two</title>
      <description>Griffin and David continue their discussion of Titanic with Emily Yoshida (Spin Magazine) and Katey Rich (Vanity Fair). But are Cameron’s drawings basic? Why is Neil deGrasse Tyson such a star bummer? Could a car really get THAT steamy? Together, they examine Paul Rudd as Jack, the STDs of 1912, CD-rom game Titanic: Adventure Out of Time and theorize why this is a mall movie.

      <description>Sam Rogal (Magnet Theatre) joins Griffin and David to discuss the 1991 hit sequel Terminator 2: Judgement Day. But do the special effects still hold up over twenty years later? What influenced the decision to make Arnold Schwarzenegger a good robot? Did Planet Hollywood ever serve a dish called pasta la vista? Together they examine the performances of Robert Patrick and Linda Hamilton, the comical amount of people shot in the knees, Arnold’s post hits career and lava in the 90’s.

      <title>The Abyss with Josh Ruben</title>
      <description>Josh Ruben (CollegeHumor) joins Griffin and David to discuss the 1989 underwater alien thriller The Abyss. But why exactly is this movie impossible to find anywhere on the internet? Just how much of wet nightmare was this production for the cast and crew? What ARE some things to do in Denver when you’re dead? Together they draw parallels certain between the lead characters failing marriage, share Chris Elliott scoops, examine Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ’s career and why Ed Harris refuses to talk about this film ever again (hint: he didn’t like being repeatedly drowned.)

      <title>Under Siege 2: Dark Territory</title>
      <description>Griffin, David and guest host Producer Ben present a special episode this week: a discussion of 1995’s action thriller Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.
But is it true the co-founder of CAA and former Disney president, Michael Ovitz, bet he could make even a stocky Aikido teacher with zero acting experience a star? Does Hollywood make these b-list midsize action movies anymore? Is Steven Seagal our quietest action hero?
Together the trio examines New Zealand director and journeyman Geoff Murphy’s career, Eric Bogosian’s performance as the scientist gone bad, earthquake inducing satellites sponsored by the U.S. government and the original song written AND performed by Steven Seagal “After the Train Has Gone.” Plus, share a Hamilton themed Burger Report, review Star Trek Beyond and what occupations Nic Cage said he would like to portray.
Finally, remember dear listener that after this week’s palette cleanser Blank Check will return with our new mini series covering the films of James Cameron!

      <itunes:summary>Griffin, David and guest host Producer Ben present a special episode this week: a discussion of 1995’s action thriller Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.
But is it true the co-founder of CAA and former Disney president, Michael Ovitz, bet he could make even a stocky Aikido teacher with zero acting experience a star? Does Hollywood make these b-list midsize action movies anymore? Is Steven Seagal our quietest action hero?
Together the trio examines New Zealand director and journeyman Geoff Murphy’s career, Eric Bogosian’s performance as the scientist gone bad, earthquake inducing satellites sponsored by the U.S. government and the original song written AND performed by Steven Seagal “After the Train Has Gone.” Plus, share a Hamilton themed Burger Report, review Star Trek Beyond and what occupations Nic Cage said he would like to portray.
Finally, remember dear listener that after this week’s palette cleanser Blank Check will return with our new mini series covering the films of James Cameron!

      <title>Roadies with Layne Montgomery</title>
      <description>Musician and Blank Check theme song creator Layne Montgomery (The Romantic Comedy) joins #thetwofriends to lock the gates in our final episode of the Cameron Crowe mini series and discuss Crowe’s most recent project, the Showtime series Roadies. But does Cameron’s return to his roots pay off? Is the portrayal of the music industry actually relevant? Will this show get another season? Together the gang examines the ten episodes (so you don’t have to) including Ron White’s performance as an embalmed corpse, Luke Wilson’s Verizon commercials and Carla Gugino's filmography.

      <title>Aloha with Esther Zuckerman</title>
      <description>Nearing the end of the Cameron Crowe mini series, Esther Zuckerman (The A.V. Club) joins Griffin and David to discuss the writer/director’s most recent theatrical release, 2015’s space militarization romantic comedy, Aloha. But doesn’t someone in Emma Stone’s camp look at this script and see at least a few red flags? Why is the movie set in Hawaii but features 99% white people? How do you make being a fighter pilot sound sexy if you’re a woman? Together, they examine Alec Baldwin’s yelling, defining gate blessings, why one can’t buy the sky and offer up their solutions to fix this film.

      <title>We Bought a Zoo</title>
      <description>Griffin and David this week discuss 2011’s zoo dramedy, We Bought a Zoo. But does the film live up to it’s title? Does someone actually buy a zoo? Together #thetwofriends examine the performances of Elle Fanning, ScarJo and John Michael Higgins as ‘Bad Zoo Boy’, propose better titles, the most embarrassing movie you’ve cried during and ghost Moms.

      <title>Elizabethtown</title>
      <description>Blank Check returns to Cameron Crowe’s filmography with an in-depth discussion of 2005’s tragic comedy, Elizabethtown. But how would one best describe the custom exercise bike Bloom’s character outfits with knives? Would Marc Maron have been better suited for the lead role? Wait, Paula Deen is in this movie? Together, Griffin and David examine the careers of Kirsten Dunst and Alec Baldwin, writer Nathan Rabin’s coining of the term “manic pixie dream girl,” Ashton Kutcher’s previous involvement in the project and the proper regional pronunciation of Louisville, Kentucky.

      <title>Vanilla Sky with Richard Lawson</title>
      <description>Richard Lawson (Vanity Fair) returns to Blank Check this week to discuss 2001’s Vanilla Sky. But just how blue collar is actor Timothy Spall? Does Tom Cruise’s character, the media magnate, also know director Steven Spielberg? Does your body make a promise when you sleep with someone? Together, they examine Penelope Cruz’s crossover performance, Cruise’s acting while masked, living in a post-Shrek America, and bucket hats.

      <title>Jerry Maguire</title>
      <description>Griffin and David this week “show you the money” with 1996’s decade defining film Jerry Maguire. What was the impact of this movie? How many memorable terms and phrases did Crowe invent that have gone on to become common place vernacular in our culture? How great is Renée Zellweger? Together they discuss the plot’s many layers, Jay Mohr as the perfect asshole, Oscar trivia and express a lot of appreciation for Jonathan Lipnicki’s stellar performance as the insanely cute kid.

      <title>Singles</title>
      <description>Griffin and David look to Crowe’s next film, 1992’s Grunge-tinged romcom Singles. But how realistically does this movie, set in Seattle, portray yuppie culture? Who the hell is actor Campbell Scott and why is he in a leading role? What’s with Producer Ben’s fascination with 90’s technology? Together, they examine making out with Paul Giamatti, various grunge musician cameos, “super” trains and terrible 90’s fashion. Also, a very special edition of Burger Report/Orange Twist Files.

      <title>Fletch</title>
      <description>In this week’s special episode, guest host Producer Ben has been given his own “Blank Check” for selecting a one-off film to review and he’s cashing it in with 1985’s cult comedy Fletch. Is this one of Chevy Chase’s strongest performances? What happened to actress Dana Wheeler-Nicholson? Out of all the movies ever made Ben picked Fletch? But why? Together, the trio discuss Chevy Chase’s tumultuous reputation and career, nostalgia for these types of comedies and character actors, Geena Davis’ impressive run of films in the late eighties to mid-nineties, and hating phonies. Plus, an in-depth hollywood history of the mythic Fletch reboot. And after this week’s palette cleanser episode Griffin and David will begin their next mini series with the films of Cameron Crowe!

      <title>The Animatrix</title>
      <description>In the final episode of the Podchowski Casters mini series, Griffin and David discuss 2003’s collection of animated short films detailing the Matrix expanded universe, The Animatrix. Are Part I and Part II of Second Renaissance a successful prequel to the first Matrix? Does the short “World Record” set it’s own record for the most on-screen knee sweat? What are #thetwofriends final thoughts on the Wachowskis? Together they examine the nine short films featuring several collaborators writers and directors including Peter Chung (Aeon Flux), reasons why Keanu Reeves might not sound like himself, the pointlessness of Alice Through the Looking Glass and why “Kid’s Story” never pays off as intended. Also, a merch spotlight, a Burger Report and why you should check out the original Animatrix website: http://www.intothematrix.com/

      <description>This week Griffin and David discuss the Wachowski’s most recent theatrical release, 2015’s intergalactic sci-fi, Jupiter Ascending. What is the Wachowski’s latest innovation in this film? Why make the very attractive Channing Tatum look like a dog? Is the original universe in this story at all logical? Listen along as they discuss space rollerblades, the parallel with Alice in Wonderland, Terry Gilliam’s costuming and Eddie Redmayne’s outstanding performance as the whispering villain Balem Abrasax. Plus, Griffin talks the Tick, box office stats and a reading from a listener submitted book report covering M. Night Shyamalan’s novel on the American education system.

      <title>Speed Racer with Emily Yoshida and J.D. Amato</title>
      <description>Guests Emily Yoshida (The Verge) and J.D. Amato (The Chris Gethard Show) make their return to Blank Check to examine 2008’s Speed Racer. But why does everyone on the panel love this movie and disagree with the criticism it received? How was this film ahead of its time? Should racing involve the financial world?

      <title>The Matrix Revolutions</title>
      <description>Concluding the Matrix trilogy, Griffin and David examine The Matrix Revolutions. But why gruesomely blind our hero Neo? What is the franchise’s message about love? Was this ending the right choice? Together, they discuss the unnecessary storyline between Captain Mifune and the Kid, Jada Pinkett Smith’s career, Dennis Franz as a potential replacement for the Oracle, and the very extended final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith.

      <title>The Matrix Reloaded</title>
      <description>This week, Griffin and David examine the highly anticipated 2003 follow up, The Matrix Reloaded. Was it a misstep to build this release around a video game (Enter the Matrix) most viewers hadn’t played and an animated series (The Animatrix) most of the audience hadn’t seen? Was it worth bringing Agent Smith back? Does David convince Griffin to reevaluate his feeling towards this film? Listen along as they discuss how most of the characters in this movie represent computer programs, the tragic loss of actress Gloria Foster during the production, the grossness of the Merovingian and Producer Ben shares his thoughts on The Keymaker.

      <title>The Matrix</title>
      <description>This week, Griffin and David discuss the Wachowski's game changing 1999 film, the Matrix. Just how big of an influence was this movie on mainstream cinema? Other than the nu metal, has this film aged gracefully? How can this only be the siblings second film?! Together, they discuss the trajectory of Keanu Reeves’ career leading up to the Matrix, their shared love for Gloria Foster’s performance as the Oracle, the superb screenwriting, and the renowned martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping. Plus, box office stats, Y2K and another edition of the Burger Report.

      <description>Blank Check returns with another new mini series, this time examining the filmography of directors the Wachowskis. And like the past investigations (George Lucas, M. Night Shyamalan), Griffin and David aim to discover how did Hollywood go on to give these auteurs free reign and what were the consequences?
Starting with 1996’s Bound, join the hosts as they discuss the greatness of Joey Pants, remembering the 90’s, Gina Gershon and the Sam Simon connection, plus why cell phones have ruined cinema.

      <title>The Visit with Louis Peitzman</title>
      <description>Louis Peitzman (BuzzFeed) joins Griffin and David to discuss the old person horror, 2015’s The Visit. But is the found footage device used in a effective way? Can the great Kathryn Hahn do no wrong? Does this mean M. Night’s very bad movie streak has finally run out? Together they examine the Blumhouse model, the gross factor versus the gore factor, a dirty diaper in the face and how Shyamalan paying out of pocket for this production might just correlate with it being actually palatable. Also, the original Slenderman, lil Roman Polanski rapping, and a Burger Report with LeBron James.

      <title>After Earth with James III</title>
      <description>James III (Black Men Can’t Jump In Hollywood Podcast) joins Griffin and David to discuss the incredibly dull, thinly veiled Scientology sci-fi, 2013’s After Earth. Beyond starring along side his son Jaden and being credited as a producer and original story writer, how else did Will Smith play a role in the making of this film? Does the timing of After Earth’s release have anything to do with Jaden’s emancipation from his parents? Is it possible for M. Night to ever work again after 5 sequential critical and commercial failures? Together they examine Will’s illustrious career up to After Earth, the development of Jaden’s stardom, having emotion, giving your monsters the ability to see and the duality of what is happening in this movie is happening in real life.

      <title>The Last Airbender with Seaton Smith</title>
      <description>Seaton Smith (Mulaney, Late Night with Seth Meyers) joins Griffin and David to discuss 2010’s agonizing, unwatchable fantasy adventure, The Last Airbender. When adapting the the original animated series, why did M. Night try to incorporate ALL 20 episodes of the first season into one movie? How do the casting choices reflect negatively on the film? Was Last Airbender so terrible that the BC crew in this episode talks about basically anything else? Yes, yes it is. Together, they examine the artist’s quest and how to avoid making your ‘Last Airbender,’ this being the first film Griffin ever auditioned for, on set stories for Chris Rock’s Top Five and Seaton meeting Woody Allen.

      <title>The Happening</title>
      <description>This week, Griffin and David discuss M. Night’s first ever R rated film, 2008’s The Happening. But is wind scary? Are any of the actors convincing they haven’t completely checked out? Why am I talking to a plastic plant? Together, #TheTwoFriends examine 9/11 imagery, why Kung Fu Panda is a better movie, impressions of nerds, and why Shyamalan calling this the “best B-movie you will ever see” is preposterous. Plus, the Departed sequel scoops and not seeing Hamilton.

      <description>Richard Lawson (Vanity Fair) joins Griffin and David to examine 2006’s egotistical bedtime martyr tale, Lady in the Water. Is M. Night trying to say something subtly about his film’s critics? Why is the lady never seen in the water? How is this a movie? Seriously. Together, the BC crew examines Giamatti’s stuttering, the cookbook misdirect payoff, the Disney controversy, and explore deep Lorax cuts. Plus, new segment the Burger Report, and the return of 'What If Al Pacino Was In This?'

Plus, new segment the Burger Report, and the return of 'What If Al Pacino Was In This?' </p><p><br></p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/blankcheck">Join our Patreon for franchise commentaries and bonus episodes</a>.</p><p>Follow us @blankcheckpod on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blankcheckpod/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@blankcheckpod?xmt=AQGzctAh4mbWTwYzCV1pzNT6AMV9o99EOfymi8TLR5mTde0">Threads</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/blankcheckpodcast/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://x.com/blankcheckpod?lang=en">X</a>! </p><p><a href="https://kinshipgoods.com/blankcheck">Buy some real nerdy merch</a>.</p><p>Connect with other Blankies on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blankies/s/gpcOkQr8Sv">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/blankies">Discord</a></p><p>For anything else, check out <a href="https://www.blankcheckpod.com/">BlankCheckPod.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Village with David Ehrlich</title>
      <description>David Ehrlich (Rolling Stone) joins Griffin and David this week for an in-depth analysis of 2004’s isolationist thriller, The Village. Why was this film so universally panned by critics and audiences? What was Adrien Brody thinking to sign up for this role after winning an Academy Award? Was this the the twist that finally did Shyamalan in or was his reputation already tarnished? Together, the gang examines the color that will remained unnamed, going “simple jack”, a popular website in the early oughts called The Smoking Gun and why for the love of all that is holy does Night keep casting himself?!

      <title>The First Annual Blank Check Awards with Joe Reid</title>
      <description>On this week’s special episode, Griffin and David joined by guest, Joe Reid (The Decider), present their personal nominations for the upcoming 88th Academy Awards. This roundtable discussion looks to all the major categories and offers engaging criticism, as well as, references deep cut cinema from 2015 you may have missed. With the “Blankies”, some winners are picked, Oscar snubs deservingly defended, but as always most of the personal grudges continue. Also, Griffin reads a listener submitted Star Wars/Blank Check crossover fan fiction titled: “Fisto and the Hoz” and Producer Ben offers up some of his own original categories. And fear not, for the twists will continue next week on Pod Night Shyamacast with episode five: The Village! Music selection: “Love Wins” by Lee Rosevere licensed under Creative Commons: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

      <title>Signs with Murf Meyer and Diana Kolsky</title>
      <description>This week’s guests on the Shyamacast are ‘real life lovers’ Murf Meyer (The Chris Gethard Show) and Diana Kolsky (Above Average), hosts in their own right of Ménage à Trois Radio, also on the UCB Comedy podcast network! And for Blank Check’s ongoing investigative mini-series of Shyamalan’s films, together with #thetwofriends they discuss 2002’s faith biased, alien invasion movie, Signs. Was it fate that it was poorly received? Was Shyamalan smart in casting himself for a role that required some real acting? How does Mel Gibson’s filmography hold up to the numerous terrible things he been quoted in public saying? Well, Blankies rejoice because this in-depth analysis leaves no glasses half empty nor half full! Also, Griffin professes his love for Chicken Run numerous times, Diana receives 7 comedy points and Murf recalls a summer of Austin Powers references.

      <title>Unbreakable with Matt Patches</title>
      <description>Matt Patches (Thrillist, Grantland) joins Griffin and David this week to discuss Shyamalan’s fourth feature, Unbreakable. This sad and muted superhero film where mostly nothing happens was seen by many critics and fans as a “sophomore slump” when released in 2000. But what are some of it’s redeeming qualities? How does it stand out among the Marvel superhero movie craze in the years that followed?
Oh and is there a twist you ask? Well listen along as the gang unpacks the making and reception of Unbreakable, together examine the stylistic choices incorporating the visual language of comic books, begin to notice a pattern of recurring themes related to loveless marriages and disturbed children, and try to shake the dead eyes of Spencer Treat Clark.

      <title>The Sixth Sense with Katey Rich</title>
      <description>Joining Griffin and David on this week’s episode is special guest Katey Rich (Vanity Fair) to help examine Shyamalan’s 1999 breakout, career defining film: The Sixth Sense. How did this unknown writer/director convince Disney to pay him 3 million dollars for the script with the clause to direct? What is the significance of red in the movie? How did this same filmmaker go on to make Lady in the Water? Are there any SIGNS of what is to come!?
Together, they discuss ghost logic, actor Toni Collette’s amazing performance, munchausen by proxy, the climate in cinema during 1999 and so much more! Plus, the gang nerds out on box office stats, Griffin revisits working with Trevor Moore on ‘Butt Whistle’ and Producer Ben presents his own original endings.

      <title>Praying with Anger/Wide Awake</title>
      <description>In the debut episode of the newly rebranded ‘Blank Check’, Griffin and David look to another director of supersized ego and skill: M. Night Shyamalan. Similar to their investigation of George Lucas’ Star Wars, the hosts aim to discover where exactly in Shyamalan’s filmography did this artist lose touch with his unique vision and become the “twist” guy?
Starting with 1992’s Praying with Anger (set in India and filmed while he was still a student at NYU), as well as, his first major-motion picture Wide Awake, join the hosts as they try to understand how these early attempts would affect his future films and the recurring themes Shyamalan would continue to explore.

      <title>Blank Check with Griffin &amp; David Trailer</title>
      <description>Blank Check is a podcast about filmographies - specifically, the filmographies of directors who've achieved massive success early on, and then were given a series of "blank checks" by the Hollywood establishment to make whatever crazy passion projects they wanted. Sometimes those checks clear (think James Cameron and "Avatar"), and sometimes they bounce, baby (like M. Night Shyamalan's "Lady in the Water"). Join hosts Griffin Newman and David Sims each week as they trace the arcs of the most intriguing directorial careers with hilarious guests and a wealth of inside knowledge. You'll never watch movies the same way again.

      <title>The Podcast Holiday Special with Pilot Viruet</title>
      <description>In 1978, CBS aired a two-hour Star Wars holiday special. Only a year prior, A New Hope had been released to critical success and with the Empire Strikes Back in production and to be released in a year and half, this was Lucasfilm’s opportunity to keep fans engaged with the franchise (and sell some merchandise of course) by developing a science fiction variety special using everyones favorite characters.
But it was terrible! So much so, that it has never been re-aired or made available for purchase ever. Nor should it be. Even George hates it, famously saying “If I had the time and a sledgehammer, I would track down every copy of the show and smash it.”
Griffin and David, joined by Pilot Viruet (Flavorwire) discuss this truly insane piece of television history. Together, they examine a storyline involving Chewbacca and Han Solo trying to return to Kasyyyk to celebrate Life Day, a Wookie holiday, Chewbaca’s weird family and extended grunting, the first introduction to Boba Fett, bad french circus dancing, 1970’s cocaine use and so much more!

      <title>The Podcast Awakens</title>
      <description>One day after the release opening of Episode VII: The Force Awakens (SPOILER ALERT!), Griffin and David discussed their impressions on the first installment of the newly revamped franchise. Together, they examine the film’s similar story structure to A New Hope, who would take new characters Resistance pilot Poe Dameron and protagonist Rey out on a classy dinner date, Kylo Ren being an evil nerd and why director J.J. Abrams accomplished where George Lucas had failed with the prequels: making an actual Star Wars movie.

      <title>A Conversation with George Lucas - Revenge Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>With Griffin and David nearing the end of their investigation into the Phantom Menace trilogy there were still a lot of unanswered questions. So they decided to invite a very special guest who played a central part in creating these three indie films to help them better understand: director George Lucas. Yes thats right Georgie Porgie himself in the flesh!
Listen in as the hosts attempt to make sense of Jar Jar Binks, Jake Lloyd’s performance, Coruscant the city planet, and more with the architect behind it all.
Also, a GIANT revelation is brought to light that completely changes everything Griffin and David thought they knew about the Star Wars universe!

      <title>Our Performance Review 3.0 with Chris Gethard - Revenge Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>This week Griffin and David complete their performance reviews of the Phantom Menace trilogy with special guest Chris Gethard (The Chris Gethard Show, Iron Man 3). Together they examine Revenge of the Sith’s entire cast and rate all the *major players–actor by actor. From unanimous MVP Ben Cooke as Kit Fisto to Jimmy Smits' portrayal of Senator Bail Organa getting a soft pass for “taking the girl” to why Silas Caron as Ki-Adi-Mundi (in one of his duel roles) kills it before being murdered and SO MUCH MORE! SERIOUSLY IT’S ALOT!
How does this exhaustive in-depth look compare to some of the actor’s rankings from the previous films? What line of dialogue is David Bowers best known for? What exactly is a salty ol’ space dog?
Plus, Chris offers new (and controversial) perspectives on the trilogy/NBA comparisons, justification for background players being good or bad and the many reasons why everyone hates General Grievous.
*Much of the cast discussed have seconds of total screen time!?

      <title>The Beginning of The End - Revenge Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>The year was 2005. George Lucas returned with the third (and final) film in the Star Wars series: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Again, taking in the criticism from the previous two productions, has the director finally found a focus? Is this a good conclusion to the Phantom Menace series?
Griffin and David begin their investigation with the opening battle sequence. And as is tradition of stunning off screen action, the movie starts at the END of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are in space fighters, R2D2 is basically Inspector Gadget now and every 45 seconds a new droid is introduced with the intention of later being merchandised. Also, we meet new characters General Grievous (the limping, coughing leader of the droid army) and a surfer Gungan. Plus, discover Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by Count Dooku (who may have lost his head.) Join your hosts in this week’s episode as they try to take it all in.

      <title>The Podcastic Two</title>
      <description>In 1992, the original Fantastic Four movie was produced by Constantin Film solely to retain the rights of the franchise. Shot in 22 days, the low budget film was never to be officially released (unbenounced to the crew and the mostly Canadian cast.)
Fast forward to early aughts and superhero films are all the rage. 20th Century Fox having acquired the licensing, after years of numerous scripts being thrown around, finally begin production on the second Fantastic Four movie in 2004. Though considered a failure among critics and fans, box office sales proved enough for 2007’s sequel, Rise of the Silver Surfer. Again, it was not good.
But then in 2015 a reboot directed by Josh Trank was released among rumors of fighting and reshoots and guess what guys IT’S ALSO BAD!
In this week’s special episode, join hosts Griffin and David as they discuss and rank all four films and why this may be the end for Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm).

      <title>The Deleted Scenes with Chase Mitchell - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>Griffin and David welcome another amazing guest this week, Chase Mitchell (The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon). Together, they discuss deleted scenes like: Anakin hanging out with Padmé’s father (who is some bum), Jocasta Nu may have had a fling with Count Doku and the Galactic Senate discussing the option to militarize or “the Binks bill.”
Griffin also reads more fan fiction this time about Dexter’s diner (OK and maybe a erotic scene between Anakin and Padmé). Plus, the gang shares their final thoughts on the film.
Is it another case solved? Did they reach any kind of conclusions? Is there some kind of huge revelation exposed in this episode? Listen and find out all these answers and more!

      <title>Digital Filmmaking with J.D. Amato - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is special guest J.D. Amato to discuss the behind-the-scenes making of this film, including, a featurette entitled: “Star Wars State Of The Art: The Pre-Visualization Of Episode II” (found in the initial DVD release of Attack of the Clones.)
Together, they examine the process of pre-visualization, why the CGI technology of its time compared even with today’s still makes this film ambitious, the uncanny valley and reasons why most of the special effects didn’t enhance or contribute to the overall story.
Though, George tried his best, why did Lucas put himself into a situation where no one could help him or this movie? Why did actors perform to no one in a blue room? Was there ever even a bigger picture or cohesive plan? Find out these answers and more!

      <title>Politics - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>7 episodes in and hosts David and Griffin are waning. This week, while attempting to discuss Senator Palpatine’s rise to power as Darth Sidious (the titular Phantom Menace), Count Doku pulling strings for the separatists, and just exactly what the Galactic Senate does for the universe they hit a major detour: Griffin reads from his awful 6th grade paper about the movie Beauty Shop.
Is the Galactic Senate like the United Nations? Or more like NATO? Why did Griffin think Amos ’n’ Andy had funny jokes?

      <title>Our Performance Review 2.0 - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>In the sixth installment of the only podcast that exclusively talks about Attack of the Clones (formally just the Phantom Menace until discovering this sequel), Griffin and David once again examine the film’s entire cast and rate all the major players–actor by actor. From Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi as most improved to Christopher Lee killing it as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus to the amazing voice acting of Ron Falk as THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE: DEXTER JETTSTER!
How do the boys rankings of some actors compare to the last review? Do their critiques take into account the once again overwhelming criticism that revolved around this film?
Plus, assessing director’s body of work such as Joel Schumacher, apparently Michael Jackson wanted to be Jar Jar Binks and remember thespians don’t blink!

      <title>The Angst Of Anakin Skywalker - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>Well he’s a teenager now: not in control of his emotions, hormone fueled, and in desperate need of discipline/a good spanking! So what does the Jedi council do? Well they put young Anakin in charge of protecting Padmé!
You mean, an important Galactic Senator with multiple attempts on her life being guarded by a Padawan that is recognized as being a bit of a wild card? Sure what could go wrong?
In this episode, your hosts Griffin and David metaphorically lock themselves in their bedrooms, blare their stereos and write bad poetry about how no one understands their pain, cause this week is a discussion of Anakin’s character arc. Including, the casting and performance of Hayden Christensen, discovering your mother has been kidnapped by Tuscan Raiders and mass murder.

      <title>The Mysterious Planet Kamino - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>It was a dark and stormy night on planet Kamino. Detective Kenobi was far far away from home. He wondered to himself in the rain: why did Sifo-Dyas place an order for a clone army 10 years ago? Why was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett chosen as the clone specimen? Who deleted Kamino from the archives?
And then the film goes on to answer none of these questions.
This week Griffin and David look at the Obi-Wan Kenobi space noir story line, including, meeting 50’s diner purveyor and forensics expert Dexter Jettster, Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu, and discuss at length the logistics of a planet that specializes in cloning.

      <itunes:summary>It was a dark and stormy night on planet Kamino. Detective Kenobi was far far away from home. He wondered to himself in the rain: why did Sifo-Dyas place an order for a clone army 10 years ago? Why was a bounty hunter named Jango Fett chosen as the clone specimen? Who deleted Kamino from the archives?
And then the film goes on to answer none of these questions.
This week Griffin and David look at the Obi-Wan Kenobi space noir story line, including, meeting 50’s diner purveyor and forensics expert Dexter Jettster, Jedi librarian Jocasta Nu, and discuss at length the logistics of a planet that specializes in cloning.

      <title>Unrest In The Galactic Senate - Attack Of The Podcast</title>
      <description>The year was 2002. It had been 3 years since the Phantom Menace. George Lucas returned with his second Star Wars release: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. But did ol’ George learn his lesson and adjust to some of the issues that critics and fans had with the previous film? Is there a clear answer to what this movie is about? Who are the clones and what are they attacking?
Griffin and David (having discovered this sequel) are excited to return to their investigation, and in this week’s episode, they dive back in looking at the first 25 minutes. Join your hosts as they get reintroduced to Padmé, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jar Jar Binks and a now grown up Anakin Skywalker, discuss the assassinations attempts, why Anakin has become such a jerk and what message Lucas has inserted in the film in regards to smoking cigarettes AKA ‘death sticks.’ Also, should Griffin’s merch spotlight continue as a segment and #PadmeDolezalYesOrNo?

      <title>Judging The Judge</title>
      <description>One year ago acclaimed actors Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall appeared together in the film The Judge. The movie is about a big city lawyer returning to his childhood home where his father, the town’s judge, is suspected of killing someone after running them over. It was directed by David Dobkin, was the first feature release from “Team Downey,” Robert and wife Susan’s production company AND Duvall even received a Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. It must be great.
No it’s a steaming pile of garbage.
You the fans did not ask for it, but in this week’s special episode hosts Griffin and David judged the Judge. Together, they discuss at length the trajectory of RDJ’s career and what lead him to turn down roles in Gravity, Oz the Great and Powerful and Inherent Vice to produce and star in the Judge, why Dobkin thinks he’s funny and why possible incest is always a great sign for drama.

      <title>Fan Fiction - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>It’s week nine into the investigation and the case is not coming together. Sooo, Griffin and David have decided to dig deep and explore the strange world of Phantom Menace fan fiction.
Perhaps these stories will help them better understand the relationship between lets say Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn? Selections include “Cards on the Table” by Emilia-Wan Kenobi, “Glory Glory Hallelujah ” by Dr. Gonzo and other entries. [Warning: This episode includes sexually explicit content]
Also, Griffin checks in with the merch corner finding a hologram Darth Sidious action figure at CVS.

      <title>Merchandise - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>Toys. Kids love them. And so do Griffin and David.
This movie’s entire production was funded by the sale of exclusive rights to the merchandising. And manufacturer Hasbro, pulled out all the stops including introducing technology that allowed the products to “talk like never before,” capturing some of the most exciting moments in toy form like a seated Jabba the Hutt watching the pod race along with color commentators Fode and Beeb, and a product (made for children) that allows someone to suck on Jar Jar Bink’s candy tongue.
So join your hosts to find out whats in Watto’s box, does Griffin buy something on Ebay he will regret and a look back at their younger selves to REMEMBER THE TOYS.

      <title>A Profile Of Jar Jar Binks And The Gungans - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>This week Griffin and David delve into the character we all know and love: Jar Jar Binks. How does an outcast of the Gungan society go on to save his people? The answer might just be tasteless comedy and a dash of racism.
Would Jar Jar Binks’ character be less offensive if developed as a noble savage rather than a goof that exclusively speaks in broken english? Did George Lucas really think he was gonna get away with it? Remember Jar Jar is for kids, right?
Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the Jar Jar Binks Pez “handler” and why Gragra is more deserving of our attention.
And dear listeners, if you have your own theory on what the Phantom Menace is really about, please send an audio recording  explanation (1-3 mins) to griffinanddavidpresent@gmail.com and it might get played on an upcoming episode!

      <title>Our Performance Review - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>In the fifth installment of the only podcast that exclusively talks about the Phantom Menace, Griffin and David look to the movie’s cast and rate all the major players–actor by actor. From finding Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi weak to Natalie Portman performance as the split roles of Queen Amidala/Padmé not horrible (and she goes on to future successes okay!) to even Tony award winning Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine just really having fun and bringing it. Also, Poor poor Jake Lloyd.
How do the boys rankings reflect on the film overall? Does their critiques live up to the overwhelming criticism that revolves around this movie?
Plus, Griffin’s chance encounter with Liam Neeson, who brings an authority called for in the role as Qui-Gon Jinn and has got gravitas for days.

      <title>Commentary with Connor Ratliff - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>Joining Griffin and David this week is host of the George Lucas Talk Show, Connor Ratliff, to discuss the commentary special feature included with the initial DVD release of the Phantom Menace. Together they review what members of the production crew (including director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, sound designer Ben Burtt, animation director Rob Coleman and more) have to say about the filming of this movie and discover new evidence of what went wrong.
Do we agree Phantom is like the act one of a play or should the focus have been on making a better stand alone movie? Why is revealing that 85% of the dialogue had to be ADR or reshooting 45 more minutes of footage a year later after principal photography not embarrassing? Could Phantom hold up as a silent film?
Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights Pepsi collectable soda cans and the golden Yoda, Connor’s fake Phantom Menace rumors that make it to Spin magazine and what is the best joke in the film.

      <title>The Jedi Council - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>This week Griffel and Simsbert discuss the Jedi Order. What are these mystical warriors all about? What is the Force? Why is Qui-Gon Jinn rigging chance cubes so that he can steal a child and casually take his blood?
Their ongoing investigation reveals new insights into many aspects of these robed street people, including: explaining the ridiculousness of midichlorians, the poorly designed “revolving-restaurant” headquarters, and why love is forbidden for all Jedi.
“Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.” - Yoda, confusing everyone

      <title>The Royalty Of Naboo - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <description>Queen elect, high school dropout, hand maiden?

This week Griffin and David look at Queen Amidala and the history of the royalty of Naboo. Why was actress Natalie Portman widely trashed for her performance in this movie? With the complicated costumes, the extravagant hair, the memorable make up, was it the strange choice to speak like a Canadian from South Park? Was Keira Knightley acting as Queen Amidala’s double supposed to be a surprise? These questions and more are answered in our next installment.

Plus, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the separately sold hyperdrive repair kit and the boys restate their hypothesis: What if this movie is about Trade Regulations?

      <title>In A Galaxy Far Far Away… - The Phantom Podcast</title>
      <link>https://audioboom.com/posts/3482075</link>
      <description>The year was 1999. It had been twenty-two years since George Lucas last directed a feature film. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was highly anticipated. But then why did the majority of audiences and critics hate it so much?



Sixteen years later, Griffin and David started this podcast with one question in mind: "what is The Phantom Menace REALLY about?" Here in their debut episode, the hosts set out to do just that by beginning their investigation with the first eight minutes of the movie. Join them as we meet Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn and protegé Obi-Wan Kenobi, the very sexual TC-14, learn about the trade federation and get some insight into how a fourteen year old girl could be elected queen of a planet. Also, Griffin talks merch where he spotlights the CommTech Communicator that made action figures talk.
